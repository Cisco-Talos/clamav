## Licensing

ClamAV is licensed for public/open source use under the GNU General Public
License, Version 2 (GPLv2).

See `COPYING.txt` for a copy of the license.

### 3rd Party Code

ClamAV contains a number of components that include code copied in part or in
whole from 3rd party projects and whose code is not owned by Cisco and which
are licensed differently than ClamAV. These include:

- tomsfastmath:  public domain
- Yara: Apache 2.0 license
  - Yara has since switched to the BSD 3-Clause License;
    Our source is out-of-date and needs to be updated.
- 7z / lzma: public domain
- libclamav's NSIS/NulSoft parser includes:
  - zlib: permissive free software license
  - bzip2 / libbzip2: BSD-like license
- OpenBSD's libc/regex: BSD license
- file: BSD license
- str.c: Contains BSD licensed modified-implementations of strtol(), stroul()
  functions, Copyright (c) 1990 The Regents of the University of California.
- pngcheck (png.c): MIT/X11-style license
- getopt.c: MIT license
- Curl: license inspired by MIT/X, but not identical
- libmspack: LGPL license
- UnRAR (libclamunrar): a non-free/restricted open source license
  - Note: The UnRAR license is incompatible with GPLv2 because it contains a
    clause that prohibits reverse engineering a RAR compression algorithm from
    the UnRAR decompression code.
    For this reason, libclamunrar/libclamunrar_iface is not linked at all with
    libclamav. It is instead loaded at run-time. If it fails to load, ClamAV
    will continue running without RAR support.

See the `COPYING` directory for a copy of the 3rd party project licenses.
