#### Using an Install Package

We provide an installer to install ClamAV on Windows to "C:\\Program Files".
This install method will require you to have Adminstrator priveleges.

We also provide a "Portable Install Package" (i.e. a zip of the required files)
for users that may wish to run ClamAV without installing it to a system-owned
directory.
