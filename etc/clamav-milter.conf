Example


##
## Main options
##

# Define the interface through which we communicate with sendmail
# This option is mandatory! Possible formats are:
# [[unix|local]:]/path/to/file - to specify a unix domain socket
# inet:port@[hostname|ip-address] - to specify an ipv4 socket
# inet6:port@[hostname|ip-address] - to specify an ipv6 socket
#
# Default: no default
#MilterSocket /tmp/clamav-milter.socket
#MilterSocket inet:7357

# Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
#
# Default: yes
#FixStaleSocket yes

# Run as another user (clamav-milter must be started by root for this option to work)
#
# Default: unset (don't drop privileges)
#User clamav

# Initialize supplementary group access (clamav-milter must be started by root).
#
# Default: no
#AllowSupplementaryGroups no

# Waiting for data from clamd will timeout after this time (seconds).
# Value of 0 disables the timeout.
#
# Default: 120
#ReadTimeout 300

# Don't fork into background.
#
# Default: no
#Foreground yes

# Chroot to the specified directory.
# Chrooting is performed just after reading the config file and before dropping privileges.
#
# Default: unset (don't chroot)
#Chroot /newroot

# This option allows you to save a process identifier of the listening
# daemon (main thread).
#
# Default: disabled
#PidFile /var/run/clamav-milter.pid

# Optional path to the global temporary directory.
# Default: system specific (usually /tmp or /var/tmp).
#
#TemporaryDirectory /var/tmp

##
## Clamd options
##

# Define the clamd socket to connect to for scanning.
# This option is mandatory! Syntax:
# ClamdSocket unix:path
# ClamdSocket tcp:host:port
# The first syntax specifies a local unix socket (needs an absolute path) e.g.:
#     ClamdSocket unix:/var/run/clamd/clamd.socket
# The second syntax specifies a tcp local or remote tcp socket: the
# host can be a hostname or an ip address; the ":port" field is only required
# for IPv6 addresses, otherwise it defaults to 3310
#     ClamdSocket tcp:192.168.0.1
#
# This option can be repeated several times with different sockets or even
# with the same socket: clamd servers will be selected in a round-robin fashion.
#
# Default: no default
#ClamdSocket tcp:scanner.mydomain:7357


##
## Exclusions
##

# Messages originating from these hosts/networks will not be scanned
# This option takes a host(name)/mask pair in CIRD notation and can be
# repeated several times. If "/mask" is omitted, a host is assumed.
# To specify a locally orignated, non-smtp, email use the keyword "local"
#
# Default: unset (scan everything regardless of the origin)
#LocalNet local
#LocalNet 192.168.0.0/24
#LocalNet 1111:2222:3333::/48

# This option specifies a file which contains a list of basic POSIX regular
# expressions. Addresses (sent to or from - see below) matching these regexes
# will not be scanned.  Optionally each line can start with the string "From:"
# or "To:" (note: no whitespace after the colon) indicating if it is, 
# respectively, the sender or recipient that is to be whitelisted.
# If the field is missing, "To:" is assumed.
# Lines starting with #, : or ! are ignored.
#
# Default unset (no exclusion applied)
#Whitelist /etc/whitelisted_addresses

# Messages from authenticated SMTP users matching this extended POSIX
# regular expression (egrep-like) will not be scanned.
# Note: this is the AUTH login name!
#
# Default: unset (no whitelisting based on SMTP auth)
#SkipAuthenticated ^(tom|dick|henry)$


##
## Actions
##

# The following group of options controls the delievery process under
# different circumstances.
# The following actions are available:
# - Accept
#   The message is accepted for delievery
# - Reject
#   Immediately refuse delievery (a 5xx error is returned to the peer)
# - Defer
#   Return a temporary failure message (4xx) to the peer
# - Blackhole (not available for OnFail)
#   Like Accept but the message is sent to oblivion
# - Quarantine (not available for OnFail)
#   Like Accept but message is quarantined instead of being delivered
#
# NOTE: In Sendmail the quarantine queue can be examined via mailq -qQ
# For Postfix this causes the message to be placed on hold
# 
# Action to be performed on clean messages (mostly useful for testing)
# Default Accept
#OnClean Accept

# Action to be performed on infected messages
# Default: Quarantine
#OnInfected Quarantine

# Action to be performed on error conditions (this includes failure to
# allocate data structures, no scanners available, network timeouts,
# unknown scanner replies and the like)
# Default Defer
#OnFail Defer

# This option allows to set a specific rejection reason for infected messages
# and it's therefore only useful together with "OnInfected Reject"
# The string "%v", if present, will be replaced with the virus name.
# Default: MTA specific
#RejectMsg 

# If this option is set to "Replace" (or "Yes"), an "X-Virus-Scanned" and an
# "X-Virus-Status" headers will be attached to each processed message, possibly
# replacing existing headers.
# If it is set to Add, the X-Virus headers are added possibly on top of the
# existing ones.
# Note that while "Replace" can potentially break DKIM signatures, "Add" may
# confuse procmail and similar filters.
# Default: no
#AddHeader Replace


##
## Logging options
##

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
#
# Default: disabled
#LogFile /tmp/clamav-milter.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamav-milter multiple times.
# This option disables log file locking.
#
# Default: no
#LogFileUnlock yes

# Maximum size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
#
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
#
# Default: no
#LogTime yes

# Use system logger (can work together with LogFile).
#
# Default: no
#LogSyslog yes

# Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man syslog'
# for facility names.
#
# Default: LOG_LOCAL6
#LogFacility LOG_MAIL

# Enable verbose logging.
#
# Default: no
#LogVerbose yes

# This option allows to tune what is logged when a message is infected.
# Possible values are Off (the default - nothing is logged),
# Basic (minimal info logged), Full (verbose info logged)
# Note:
# For this to work properly in sendmail, make sure the msg_id, mail_addr,
# rcpt_addr and i macroes are available in eom. In other words add a line like:
# Milter.macros.eom={msg_id}, {mail_addr}, {rcpt_addr}, i
# to your .cf file. Alternatively use the macro:
# define(`confMILTER_MACROS_EOM', `{msg_id}, {mail_addr}, {rcpt_addr}, i')
# Postfix should be working fine with the default settings.
#
# Default: disabled
#LogInfected Basic


##
## Limits
##

# Messages larger than this value won't be scanned.
# Make sure this value is lower or equal than StreamMaxLength in clamd.conf
#
# Default: 25M
#MaxFileSize 10M
