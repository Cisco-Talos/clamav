Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
#LogFile /tmp/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if you want to run another clamd instance,
# please # copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with the --config-file option).
# This option disables log file locking.
# Default: disabled
#LogFileUnlock

# Maximal size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
# Default: disabled
#LogTime

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.
# Default: disabled
#LogClean

# Use system logger (can work together with LogFile).
# Default: disabled
#LogSyslog

# Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man syslog'
# for facility names.

# Enable verbose logging.
# Default: disabled
#LogVerbose

# This option allows you to save a process identifier of the listening
# daemon (main thread).
# Default: disabled
#PidFile /var/run/clamd.pid

# Optional path to the global temporary directory.
# Default: system specific (usually /tmp or /var/tmp).
#TemporaryDirectory /var/tmp

# Path to the database directory.
# Default: hardcoded (depends on installation options)
#DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav

# The daemon works in a local OR a network mode. Due to security reasons we
# recommend the local mode.

# Path to a local socket file the daemon will listen on.
# Default: disabled
LocalSocket /tmp/clamd

# Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
# Default: disabled
FixStaleSocket

# TCP port address.
# Default: disabled
#TCPSocket 3310

# TCP address.
# By default we bind to INADDR_ANY, probably not wise.
# Enable the following to provide some degree of protection
# from the outside world.
# Default: disabled
#TCPAddr 127.0.0.1

# Maximum length the queue of pending connections may grow to.
# Default: 15
#MaxConnectionQueueLength 30

# Clamd uses FTP-like protocol to receive data from remote clients.
# If you are using clamav-milter to balance load between remote clamd daemons
# on firewall servers you may need to tune the options below.

# Close the connection when the data size limit is exceeded.
# The value should match your MTA's limit for a maximal attachment size.
# Default: 10M
#StreamMaxLength 20M

# Limit port range.
# Default: 1024
#StreamMinPort 30000
# Default: 2048

# Default: 30
#IdleTimeout 60

# Maximal depth directories are scanned at.
# Default: 15
#MaxDirectoryRecursion 20

# Follow directory symlinks.
# Default: disabled
#FollowDirectorySymlinks

# Follow regular file symlinks.
# Default: disabled
#FollowFileSymlinks

# Perform internal sanity check (database integrity and freshness).
# Default: 1800 (30 min)
#SelfCheck 600

# Execute a command when virus is found. In the command string %v will
# be replaced by a virus name.
# Default: disabled
#VirusEvent /usr/local/bin/send_sms 123456789 "VIRUS ALERT: %v"

# Run as a selected user (clamd must be started by root).

#ExitOnOOM

# Don't fork into background.
# Default: disabled
#Foreground

# Enable debug messages in libclamav.

# By default clamd uses scan options recommended by libclamav. This option
# disables recommended options and allows you to enable selected ones below.
# DO NOT TOUCH IT unless you know what you are doing.
# Default: disabled
#DisableDefaultScanOptions

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows
# ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite.
# Default: enabled
#ScanPE

# With this option clamav will try to detect broken executables and mark
# them as Broken.Executable
# Default: disabled
#DetectBrokenExecutables


##
## Documents
##

# This option enables scanning of Microsoft Office document macros.
# Default: enabled
#ScanOLE2

##
## Mail files
##

# Enable internal e-mail scanner.
# Default: enabled
#ScanMail

# If an email contains URLs ClamAV can download and scan them.
# WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack.
#	   Never use it on loaded servers.
# Default: disabled
#MailFollowURLs


##
## HTML
##

# Perform HTML normalisation and decryption of MS Script Encoder code.
# Default: enabled
#ScanHTML


##
## Archives
##

# ClamAV can scan within archives and compressed files.
# Default: enabled
#ScanArchive

# Due to license issues libclamav does not support RAR 3.0 archives (only the
# old 2.0 format is supported). Because some users report stability problems
# with unrarlib it's disabled by default and you must uncomment the directive
# below to enable RAR 2.0 support.
# Default: disabled
#ScanRAR

# The options below protect your system against Denial of Service attacks
# using archive bombs.

# Files in archives larger than this limit won't be scanned.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 10M
#ArchiveMaxFileSize 15M

# Nested archives are scanned recursively, e.g. if a Zip archive contains a RAR
# file, all files within it will also be scanned. This options specifies how
# deep the process should be continued.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 8
#ArchiveMaxRecursion 9

# Number of files to be scanned within an archive.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 1000
#ArchiveMaxFiles 1500

# If a file in an archive is compressed more than ArchiveMaxCompressionRatio
# times it will be marked as a virus (Oversized.ArchiveType, e.g. Oversized.Zip)
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 250
#ArchiveMaxCompressionRatio 300

# Use slower but memory efficient decompression algorithm.
# only affects the bzip2 decompressor.
# Default: disabled
#ArchiveLimitMemoryUsage

# Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
# Default: disabled
#ArchiveBlockEncrypted

# Mark archives as viruses (e.g. RAR.ExceededFileSize, Zip.ExceededFilesLimit)
# if ArchiveMaxFiles, ArchiveMaxFileSize, or ArchiveMaxRecursion limit is
# reached.
# Default: disabled
#ArchiveBlockMax

##	    up your system!!!

#ClamukoIncludePath /students

# Set the exclude paths. All subdirectories are also excluded.
# Default: disabled
