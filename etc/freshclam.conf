# When enabled freshclam will submit statistics to the ClamAV Project about
# the latest virus detections in your environment. The ClamAV maintainers
# will then use this data to determine what types of malware are the most
# detected in the field and in what geographic area they are.
# This feature requires LogTime and LogFile to be enabled in clamd.conf.
# Default: no
#SubmitDetectionStats /path/to/clamd.conf

# Country of origin of malware/detection statistics (for statistical
# purposes only). The statistics collector at ClamAV.net will look up
# your IP address to determine the geographical origin of the malware
# reported by your installation. If this installation is mainly used to
# scan data which comes from a different location, please enable this
# option and enter a two-letter code (see http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/)
# of the country of origin.
# Default: disabled
#DetectionStatsCountry country-code

# This option enables support for Google Safe Browsing. When activated for
# the first time, freshclam will download a new database file (safebrowsing.cvd)
# which will be automatically loaded by clamd and clamscan during the next
# reload, provided that the heuristic phishing detection is turned on. This
# database includes information about websites that may be phishing sites or
# possible sources of malware. When using this option, it's mandatory to run
# freshclam at least every 30 minutes.
# Freshclam uses the ClamAV's mirror infrastructure to distribute the
# database and its updates but all the contents are provided under Google's
# terms of use. See http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=70015
# and http://safebrowsing.clamav.net for more information.
# Default: disabled
#SafeBrowsing yes
