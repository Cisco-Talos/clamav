# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
#LogFile /tmp/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please

# Maximum size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers. If LogFileMaxSize is enabled, log
# rotation (the LogRotate option) will always be enabled.
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
# Default: no
#LogTime yes

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.

# Enable non-blocking (multi-threaded/concurrent) database reloads.
# This feature will temporarily load a second scanning engine while scanning
# continues using the first engine. Once loaded, the new engine takes over.
# The old engine is removed as soon as all scans using the old engine have
# completed.
# This feature requires more RAM, so this option is provided in case users are
# willing to block scans during reload in exchange for lower RAM requirements.
# Default: yes
#ConcurrentDatabaseReload no

# Execute a command when virus is found. In the command string %v will
# be replaced with the virus name and %f will be replaced with the file name.

# Only include a specific PUA category. This directive can be used multiple
# times.
# Default: Load all categories (if DetectPUA is activated)
#IncludePUA Spy
#IncludePUA Scanner
#IncludePUA RAT

# This option causes memory or nested map scans to dump the content to disk.
# If you turn on this option, more data is written to disk and is available
# when the LeaveTemporaryFiles option is enabled.
#ForceToDisk yes

# This option allows you to disable the caching feature of the engine. By
# default, the engine will store an MD5 in a cache of any files that are
# not flagged as virus or that hit limits checks. Disabling the cache will
# have a negative performance impact on large scans.
# Default: no
#DisableCache yes

# In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others),
# ClamAV uses special algorithms to detect abnormal patterns and behaviors that
# may be malicious.  This option enables alerting on such heuristically
# detected potential threats.
# Default: yes
#HeuristicAlerts yes

# Allow heuristic alerts to take precedence.
# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU
# scan-time.
# When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only
# at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported
#
# Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "Heuristics.*" viruses
# differently from "real" malware.
# If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,
# the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
#
# Default: no
#HeuristicScanPrecedence yes

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option
# allows ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite. If you turn off this option, the original files will still be
# scanned, but without additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanPE yes

# Certain PE files contain an authenticode signature. By default, we check
# the signature chain in the PE file against a database of trusted and
# revoked certificates if the file being scanned is marked as a virus.
# If any certificate in the chain validates against any trusted root, but
# does not match any revoked certificate, the file is marked as trusted.
# If the file does match a revoked certificate, the file is marked as virus.
# The following setting completely turns off authenticode verification.
# Default: no
#DisableCertCheck yes

# Max number of scanning threads to allocate to the OnAccess thread pool at
# startup. These threads are the ones responsible for creating a connection
# with the daemon and kicking off scanning after an event has been processed.
# To prevent clamonacc from consuming all clamd's resources keep this lower
# than clamd's max threads.
# Default: 5
#OnAccessMaxThreads 10

# Max amount of time (in milliseconds) that the OnAccess client should spend
# for every connect, send, and recieve attempt when communicating with clamd
# via curl.
# Default: 5000 (5 seconds)
# OnAccessCurlTimeout 10000

# Toggles dynamic directory determination. Allows for recursively watching
# include paths.

#OnAccessIncludePath /home
#OnAccessIncludePath /students

# Set the exclude paths. All subdirectories are also excluded.
# Default: disabled
#OnAccessExcludePath /home/user

# Modifies fanotify blocking behaviour when handling permission events.
# If off, fanotify will only notify if the file scanned is a virus,
# and not perform any blocking.
# Default: no
#OnAccessPrevention yes

# When using prevention, if this option is turned on, any errors that occur
# during scanning will result in the event attempt being denied. This could
# potentially lead to unwanted system behaviour with certain configurations,
# so the client defaults this to off and prefers allowing access events in
# case of scan or connection error.
# Default: no
#OnAccessDenyOnError yes

# Toggles extra scanning and notifications when a file or directory is
# created or moved.
# Requires the  DDD system to kick-off extra scans.
# Default: no
#OnAccessExtraScanning yes

# Set the  mount point to be scanned. The mount point specified, or the mount
# point containing the specified directory will be watched. If any directories
# are specified, this option will preempt (disable and ignore all options
# related to) the DDD system. This option will result in verdicts only.
# Note that prevention is explicitly disallowed to prevent common, fatal
# misconfigurations. (e.g. watching "/" with prevention on and no exclusions
# made on vital system directories)
# It can be used multiple times.
# Default: disabled
#OnAccessMountPath /
#OnAccessMountPath /home/user

# With this option you can exclude the root UID (0). Processes run under
# root with be able to access all files without triggering scans or
# permission denied events.
# Note that if clamd cannot check the uid of the process that generated an
# on-access scan event (e.g., because OnAccessPrevention was not enabled, and
# the process already exited), clamd will perform a scan.  Thus, setting
# OnAccessExcludeRootUID is not *guaranteed* to prevent every access by the
# root user from triggering a scan (unless OnAccessPrevention is enabled).
# Default: no
#OnAccessExcludeRootUID no

# With this option you can exclude specific UIDs. Processes with these UIDs
# will be able to access all files without triggering scans or permission
# denied events.
# This option can be used multiple times (one per line).
# Using a value of 0 on any line will disable this option entirely.
# To exclude the root UID (0) please enable the OnAccessExcludeRootUID
# option.
# Also note that if clamd cannot check the uid of the process that generated an
# on-access scan event (e.g., because OnAccessPrevention was not enabled, and
# the process already exited), clamd will perform a scan.  Thus, setting
# OnAccessExcludeUID is not *guaranteed* to prevent every access by the
# specified uid from triggering a scan (unless OnAccessPrevention is enabled).
# Default: disabled
#OnAccessExcludeUID -1

# This option allows exclusions via user names when using the on-access
# scanning client. It can be used multiple times.
# It has the same potential race condition limitations of the
# OnAccessExcludeUID option.
# Default: disabled
#OnAccessExcludeUname clamav

# Number of times the OnAccess client will retry a failed scan due to
# connection problems (or other issues).
# Default: 0

## Bytecode
##

# With this option enabled ClamAV will load bytecode from the database.
# It is highly recommended you keep this option on, otherwise you'll miss
# detections for many new viruses.
# Default: yes
#Bytecode yes

# Set bytecode security level.
# Possible values:
#   None -      No security at all, meant for debugging.
#               DO NOT USE THIS ON PRODUCTION SYSTEMS.
#               This value is only available if clamav was built
#               with --enable-debug!
#   TrustSigned - Trust bytecode loaded from signed .c[lv]d files, insert
#               runtime safety checks for bytecode loaded from other sources.
#   Paranoid -  Don't trust any bytecode, insert runtime checks for all.
# Recommended: TrustSigned, because bytecode in .cvd files already has these
# checks.
# Note that by default only signed bytecode is loaded, currently you can only
# load unsigned bytecode in --enable-debug mode.
#
# Default: TrustSigned
#BytecodeSecurity TrustSigned

# Allow loading bytecode from outside digitally signed .c[lv]d files.
# **Caution**: You should NEVER run bytecode signatures from untrusted sources.
# Doing so may result in arbitrary code execution.
# Default: no
#BytecodeUnsigned yes

# Set bytecode timeout in milliseconds.
#
# Default: 5000
# BytecodeTimeout 1000
