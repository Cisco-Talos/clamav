Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
#LogFile /tmp/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please
# copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with --config-file option).
# This option disables log file locking.
# Default: no
#LogFileUnlock yes

# Maximum size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers. If LogFileMaxSize is enabled, log
# rotation (the LogRotate option) will always be enabled.
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
# Default: no
#LogTime yes

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.

# Maximum number of queued items (including those being processed by MaxThreads threads)
# It is recommended to have this value at least twice MaxThreads if possible.
# WARNING: you shouldn't increase this too much to avoid running out  of file descriptors,
# the following condition should hold:
# MaxThreads*MaxRecursion + (MaxQueue - MaxThreads) + 6< RLIMIT_NOFILE (usual max is 1024)
#
# Default: 100
#MaxQueue 200

# This option causes memory or nested map scans to dump the content to disk.
# If you turn on this option, more data is written to disk and is available
# when the LeaveTemporaryFiles option is enabled.
#ForceToDisk yes

# This option allows you to disable the caching feature of the engine. By
# default, the engine will store an MD5 in a cache of any files that are
# not flagged as virus or that hit limits checks. Disabling the cache will
# have a negative performance impact on large scans.
# Default: no
#DisableCache yes

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows
# ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite. If you turn off this option, the original files will still be
# scanned, but without additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanPE yes

# Certain PE files contain an authenticode signature. By default, we check
# the signature chain in the PE file against a database of trusted and
# revoked certificates if the file being scanned is marked as a virus.
# If any certificate in the chain validates against any trusted root, but
# does not match any revoked certificate, the file is marked as whitelisted.
# If the file does match a revoked certificate, the file is marked as virus.
# The following setting completely turns off authenticode verification.
# Default: no
#DisableCertCheck yes

# Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X executables.
# This option allows you to control the scanning of ELF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanELF yes

# With this option clamav will try to detect broken executables (both PE and
# ELF) and mark them as Broken.Executable.
# Default: no
#DetectBrokenExecutables yes


##
## Documents
##

# This option enables scanning of OLE2 files, such as Microsoft Office
# documents and .msi files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanOLE2 yes

# With this option enabled OLE2 files with VBA macros, which were not
# detected by signatures will be marked as "Heuristics.OLE2.ContainsMacros".
# Default: no
#OLE2BlockMacros no

# This option enables scanning within PDF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without decoding and additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanPDF yes

# This option enables scanning within SWF files.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without decoding and additional processing.
# Default: yes
#ScanSWF yes


##
## Mail files
##

# Enable internal e-mail scanner.
# If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned, but
# without parsing individual messages/attachments.
# Default: yes
#ScanMail yes

# Scan RFC1341 messages split over many emails.
# You will need to periodically clean up $TemporaryDirectory/clamav-partial directory.

#	   Never use it on loaded servers.
# Default: no
#ScanPartialMessages yes

# With this option enabled ClamAV will try to detect phishing attempts by using
# signatures.
# Default: yes
#PhishingSignatures yes

# Scan URLs found in mails for phishing attempts using heuristics.
# Default: yes
#PhishingScanURLs yes

# Always block SSL mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in the database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch no

# Always block cloaked URLs, even if URL isn't in database.
# This can lead to false positives.
#
# Default: no
#PhishingAlwaysBlockCloak no

# Detect partition intersections in raw disk images using heuristics.
# Default: no
#PartitionIntersection no

# Allow heuristic match to take precedence.
# When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects
# a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU
# scan-time.
# When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at
# the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected
# virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported
#
# Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses 
# differently from "real" malware.
# If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, 
# the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
#
# Default: no
#HeuristicScanPrecedence yes
