# ClamAV News

Note: This file refers to the source tarball. Things described here may differ
 slightly from the binary packages.

## 0.101.0

ClamAV 0.101.0 is in development!

Here are the new features and improvements found in 0.101.0 in addition to
an assortment of minor fixes:

- User manual has been converted from latex/pdf/html over to Markdown. Markdown
  is easier to read & edit than latex, and is easier to contribute to as it
  eliminates the need to generate documents (the PDF, HTML).  Find the user
  manual under docs/UserManual[.md].
- Backwards compatibility improvements for detecting the OpenSSL dependency.

## 0.100.1

ClamAV 0.100.1 is a hotfix release to patch a set of vulnerabilities.

- Fixes for the following CVE's:
  - [CVE-2017-16932](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-16932):
    Vulnerability in libxml2 dependency (affects ClamAV on Windows only).
  - [CVE-2018-0360](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0360):
    HWP integer overflow, infinite loop vulnerability.
    Reported by Secunia Research at Flexera.
  - [CVE-2018-0361](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0361):
    ClamAV PDF object length check, unreasonably long time to parse relatively
    small file.  Reported by aCaB.

## 0.100.0

ClamAV 0.100.0 is a feature release which includes many code submissions
 from the ClamAV community.  As always, it can be downloaded from our downloads
 page on clamav.net. Some of the more prominent submissions include:

- Interfaces to the Prelude SIEM open source package for collecting
  ClamAV virus events.
- Support for Visual Studio 2015 for Windows builds.  Please note that we
  have deprecated support for Windows XP, and while Vista may still work,
  we no longer test ClamAV on Windows XP or Vista.
- Support libmspack internal code or as a shared object library.
  The internal library is the default and includes modifications to enable
  parsing of CAB files that do not entirely adhere to the CAB file format.
- Linking with OpenSSL 1.1.0.
- Deprecation of the AllowSupplementaryGroups parameter statement
  in clamd, clamav-milter, and freshclam. Use of supplementary
  is now in effect by default.
- Numerous bug fixes, typo corrections, and compiler warning fixes.

Additionally, we have introduced important changes and new features in
ClamAV 0.100, including but not limited to:

- Deprecating internal LLVM code support. The configure script has changed
  to search the system for an installed instance of the LLVM development
  libraries, and to otherwise use the bytecode interpreter for ClamAV
  bytecode signatures. To use the LLVM Just-In-Time compiler for
  executing bytecode signatures, please ensure that the LLVM development
  package at version 3.6 or lower is installed. Using the deprecated LLVM
  code is possible with the command: `./configure --with-system-llvm=no`,
  but it no longer compiles on all platforms.
- Compute and check PE import table hash (a.k.a. "imphash") signatures.
- Support file property collection and analysis for MHTML files.
- Raw scanning of PostScript files.
- Fix clamsubmit to use the new virus and false positive submission web
  interface.
- Optionally, flag files with the virus "Heuristic.Limits.Exceeded" when
  size limitations are exceeded.
- Improved decoders for PDF files.
- Reduced number of compile time warnings.
- Improved support for C++11.
- Improved detection of system installed libraries.
- Fixes to ClamAV's Container system and the introduction of Intermediates
  for more descriptive signatures.
- Improvements to clamd's On-Access scanning capabilities for Linux.

### Known Issues

ClamAV has an active issue queue and enjoys continual improvement but as sad as
 I am to say it, we couldn't address every bug in this release.  I want to draw
 your attention a couple bugs in particular so as not to frustrate users
 setting up ClamAV:

- Platform: macOS:
  - Bug:  If you attempt to build ClamAV with a system installed LLVM you may
    receive a linker error.  We recently changed default linking behavior to
    prefer dynamic linking over static linking.  As a result, we've uncovered a
    bug in building on macOS where dynamic linking against the LLVM libraries
    fails.  To work around this bug, please add the --with-llvm-linking=static
    option to your ./configure call.

- Platform: CentOS 6 32bit, older versions of AIX:
  - Bug:  On CentOS 6 32bit we observed that specific versions of zlib fail to
    correctly decompress the CVD signature databases.  If you are on an older
    system such as CentoOS 6 32bit and observe failures loading the signature
    database, please consider upgrading to a newer version of zlib.

- Platform: Miscellaneous
  - Bug:  When cross compiling on certain legacy systems (Solaris, AIX, OSX)
    against older system libraries that do not support strn functions linking
    may fail during compile time. While automatic checking is done during
    configure time to check for unsupported libs, this problem can be manually
    avoided using the --enable-strni configure flag if it is encountered.

## 0.99.4

ClamAV 0.99.4 is a hotfix release to patch a set of vulnerabilities.

  all-match mode. Any applications using all-match mode must use 
  the new callback function to record and report detected viruses.    
- Configurable default password list to attempt zip file decryption.
- TIFF file support.
- Upgrade Windows pthread library to 2.9.1.
- A new signature target type for designating signatures to run
  against files with unknown file types.
- Improved fidelity of the "data loss prevention" heuristic
  algorithm. Code supplied by Bill Parker.
- Support for LZMA decompression within Adobe Flash files.
- Support for MSO attachments within Microsoft Office 2003 XML files.

## 0.98.5

Welcome to ClamAV 0.98.5! ClamAV 0.98.5 includes important new features
for collecting and analyzing file properties. Software developers and
analysts may collect file property meta data using the ClamAV API for
subsequent analysis by ClamAV bytecode programs. Using these features
will require that libjson-c is installed, but otherwise libjson-c is not
needed.

Look for our upcoming series of blog posts to learn more about using the
ClamAV API and bytecode facilities for collecting and analyzing file
properties.

ClamAV 0.98.5 also includes these new features and bug fixes:

- Support for the XDP file format and extracting, decoding, and
  scanning PDF files within XDP files.
- Addition of shared library support for LLVM versions 3.1 - 3.5
  for the purpose of just-in-time(JIT) compilation of ClamAV
  bytecode signatures. Andreas Cadhalpun submitted the patch
  implementing this support.
- Enhancements to the clambc command line utility to assist
  ClamAV bytecode signature authors by providing introspection
  into compiled bytecode programs.
- Resolution of many of the warning messages from ClamAV compilation.
- Improved detection of malicious PE files.
- Security fix for ClamAV crash when using 'clamscan -a'. This issue
  was identified by Kurt Siefried of Red Hat.

Here are the new features and improvements in ClamAV 0.98.2:

- Support for common raw disk image formats using 512 byte sectors,
  specifically GPT, APM, and MBR partitioning.
- Experimental support of OpenIOC files. ClamAV will now extract file
  hashes from OpenIOC files residing in the signature database location,
  and generate ClamAV hash signatures. ClamAV uses no other OpenIOC
  features at this time. No OpenIOC files will be delivered through
  freshclam. See openioc.org and iocbucket.com for additional information
  about OpenIOC.
- All ClamAV sockets (clamd, freshclam, clamav-milter, clamdscan, clamdtop)
  now support IPV6 addresses and configuration parameters.
- Use OpenSSL file hash functions for improved performance. OpenSSL 
  is now prerequisite software for ClamAV 0.98.2.
- Improved detection of malware scripts within image files. Issue reported
  by Maarten Broekman.
- Change to circumvent possible denial of service when processing icons within
  specially crafted PE files. Icon limits are now in place with corresponding
  clamd and clamscan configuration parameters. This issue was reported by 
  Joxean Koret.
- Improvements to the fidelity of the ClamAV pattern matcher, an issue
  reported by Christian Blichmann.
- Opt-in collection of statistics. Statistics collected are: sizes and MD5 
  hashes of files, PE file section counts and section MD5 hashes, and names
  and counts of detected viruses. Enable statistics collection with the
  --enable-stats clamscan flag or StatsEnabled clamd configuration
  parameter.
- Improvements to ClamAV build process, unit tests, and platform support with
  assistance and suggestions by Sebastian Andrzej Siewior, Scott Kitterman,
  and Dave Simonson.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders give
permission to link the code of portions of this program with the 
OpenSSL library under certain conditions as described in each
individual source file, and distribute linked combinations
including the two.

You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects
for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify
file(s) with this exception, you may extend this exception to your

files in the program, then also delete it here.

## 0.98.1

ClamAV 0.98.1 provides improved support of Mac OS X platform, support for new file types, and 
quality improvements. These include:

- Extraction, decompression, and scanning of files within Apple Disk Image (DMG) format.

- Extraction, decompression, and scanning of files within Extensible Archive (XAR) format.
  XAR format is commonly used for software packaging, such as PKG and RPM, as well as 
  general archival.

- Decompression and scanning of files in "Xz" compression format.

- Recognition of Open Office XML formats.

- Improvements and fixes to extraction and scanning of ole formats.

- Option to force all scanned data to disk. This impacts only a few file types where
  some embedded content is normally scanned in memory. Enabling this option
  ensures that a file descriptor exists when callback functions are used, at a small
  performance cost. This should only be needed when callback functions are used
  that need file access.

- Various improvements to ClamAV configuration, support of third party libraries, 
  and unit tests.

## 0.98

ClamAV 0.98 includes many new features, across all the different components
of ClamAV. There are new scanning options, extensions to the libclamav API,
support for additional filetypes, and internal upgrades.

- Signature improvements: New signature targets have been added for
  PDF files, Flash files and Java class files. (NOTE: Java archive files
  (JAR) are not part of the Java target.) Hash signatures can now specify
  a '*' (wildcard)  size if the size is unknown. Using wildcard size
  requires setting the minimum engine FLEVEL to avoid backwards
  compatibility issues. For more details read the ClamAV Signatures
  guide.

- Scanning enhancements: New filetypes can be unpacked and scanned,
  including ISO9660, Flash, and self-extracting 7z files. PDF
  handling is now more robust and better handles encrypted PDF files.

- Authenticode: ClamAV is now aware of the certificate chains when
  scanning signed PE files. When the database contains signatures for
  trusted root certificate authorities, the engine can whitelist
  PE files with a valid signature. The same database file can also
  include known compromised certificates to be rejected! This
  feature can also be disabled in clamd.conf (DisableCertCheck) or
  the command-line (nocerts).

- New options: Several new options for clamscan and clamd have been
  added. For example, ClamAV can be set to print infected files and
  error files, and suppress printing OK results. This can be helpful
  when scanning large numbers of files. This new option is "-o" for
  clamscan and "LogClean" for clamd. Check clamd.conf or the clamscan
  help message for specific details.

- New callbacks added to the API: The libclamav API has additional hooks
  for developers to use when wrapping ClamAV scanning. These function
  types are prefixed with "clcb_" and allow developers to add logic at 
  certain steps of the scanning process without directly modifying the 
  library. For more details refer to the clamav.h file.

- More configurable limits: Several hardcoded values are now configurable
  parameters, providing more options for tuning the engine to match your
  needs. Check clamd.conf or the clamscan help message for specific
  details.

- Performance improvements: This release furthers the use of memory maps
  during scanning and unpacking, continuing the conversion started in
  prior releases. Complex math functions have been switched from
  libtommath to tomsfastmath functions. The A/C matcher code has also
  been optimized to provide a speed boost.

- Support for on-access scanning using Clamuko/Dazuko has been replaced
  with fanotify. Accordingly, clamd.conf settings related to on-access
  scanning have had Clamuko removed from the name. Clamuko-specific
  configuration items have been marked deprecated and should no longer
  be used.

There are also fixes for other minor issues and code quality changes. Please
see the ChangeLog file for details.

## 0.96

This release of ClamAV introduces new malware detection mechanisms and other
significant improvements to the scan engine. The key features include:

- The Bytecode Interpreter: the interpreter built into LibClamAV allows
  the signature writers to create and distribute very complex detection
  routines and remotely enhance the scanner's functionality

- Heuristic improvements: improve the PE heuristics detection engine by
  adding support of bogus icons and fake PE header information. In a
  nutshell, ClamAV can now detect malware that tries to disguise itself
  as a harmless application by using the most common Windows program icons.

- Signature Improvements: logical signature improvements to allow more
  detailed matching and referencing groups of signatures. Additionally,
  improvements to wildcard matching on word boundaries and newlines.

- Support for new archives: 7zip, InstallShield and CPIO. LibClamAV
  can now transparently unpack and inspect their contents.

- Support for new executable file formats: 64-bit ELF files and OS X
  Universal Binaries with Mach-O files. Additionally, the PE module
  can now decompress and inspect executables packed with UPX 3.0.

- Support for DazukoFS in clamd

- Performance improvements: overall performance improvements and memory
  optimizations for a better overall resource utilization experience.

- Native Windows Support: ClamAV will now build natively under Visual
  Studio. This will allow 3rd Party application developers on Windows
  to easily integrate LibClamAV into their applications.

The complete list of changes is available in the ChangeLog file. For upgrade

## 0.95

ClamAV 0.95 introduces many bugfixes, improvements and additions. To make
the transition easier, we put various tips and upgrade notes on this page:
https://wiki.clamav.net/Main/UpgradeNotes095. For detailed list of changes
and bugfixes, please see the ChangeLog.

The following are the key features of this release:

- Google Safe Browsing support: in addition to the heuristic and signature
  based phishing detection mechanisms already available in ClamAV, the
  scanner can now make use of the Google's blacklists of suspected
  phishing and malware sites. The ClamAV Project distributes a constantly
  updated Safe Browsing database, which can be automatically fetched by
  freshclam. For more information, please see freshclam.conf(5) and
  https://www.clamav.net/documents/safebrowsing.

- New clamav-milter: The program has been redesigned and rewritten from
  scratch. The most notable difference is that the internal mode has been
  dropped which means that now a working clamd companion is required.
  The milter now also has its own configuration file.

- Clamd extensions: The protocol has been extended to lighten the load
  that clamd puts on the system, solve limitations of the old protocol,
  and reduce latency when signature updates are received. For more
  information about the new extensions please see the official
  documentation and the upgrade notes.

- Improved API: The API used to program ClamAV's engine (libclamav) has
  been redesigned to use modern object-oriented techniques and solves
  various API/ABI compatibility issues between old and new releases.
  You can find more information in Section 6 of clamdoc.pdf and in
  the upgrade notes.

- ClamdTOP: This is a new program that allows system administrators to
  monitor clamd. It provides information about the items in the clamd's
  queue, clamd's memory usage, and the version of the signature database,
  all in real-time and in nice curses-based interface.

- Memory Pool Allocator: Libclamav now includes its own memory pool
  allocator based on memory mapping. This new solution replaces the
  traditional malloc/free system for the copy of the signatures that
  is kept in memory. As a result, clamd requires much less memory,
  particularly when signature updates are received and the database is
  loaded into memory.

- Unified Option Parser: Prior to version 0.95 each program in ClamAV's
  suite of programs had its own set of runtime options. The new general
  parser brings consistency of use and validation to these options across
  the suite. Some command line switches of clamscan have been renamed
  (the old ones will still be accepted but will have no effect and will
  result in warnings), please see clamscan(1) and clamscan --help for
  the details.

## 0.94.2

This is a bugfix release, please refer to the ChangeLog for a complete
list of changes.

--
The ClamAV team (https://www.clamav.net/about.html#credits)

## 0.94.1

ClamAV 0.94.1 fixes some issues that were found in previous releases and
includes one new feature, "Malware Statistics Gathering." This is an optional
feature that allows ClamAV users optionally to submit statistics to us about
what they detect in the field. We will then use these data to determine what
types of malware are the most detected in the field and in what geographic
area they are. It will also allow us to publish summary data on www.clamav.net
where our users will be able to monitor the latest threats. You can help us
by enabling SubmitDetectionStats in freshclam.conf.

For more details, please refer to the ChangeLog

## 0.94

Sourcefire and the ClamAV team are pleased to announce the release of
ClamAV 0.94. The following are the key features and improvements of this
version:

- Logical Signatures: The logical signature technology uses operators
  such as AND, OR and NOT to allow the combination of more than one
  signature into one entry in the signature database resulting in
  more detailed and flexible pattern matching.

- Anti-phishing Technology: Users can now change the priority and reporting
  of ClamAV's heuristic anti-phishing scanner within the detection engine
  process. They can choose whether, when scanning a suspicious file, ClamAV
  should stop scanning and report the phish, or continue to scan in case the
  file contains other malware (clamd: HeuristicScanPrecedence,
  clamscan: --heuristic-scan-precedence)

- Disassembly Engine: The initial version of the disassembly engine improves
  ClamAV's detection abilities.

- PUA Detection: Users can now decide which PUA signatures should be loaded
  (clamd: ExcludePUA, IncludePUA; clamscan: --exclude-pua, --include-pua)

- Data Loss Prevention (DLP): This version includes a new module that, when
  enabled, scans data for the inclusion of US formated Social Security
  Numbers and credit card numbers (clamd: StructuredDataDetection,
  clamscan: --detect-structured; additional fine-tuning options are available)

- IPv6 Support: Freshclam now supports IPv6

- Improved Scanning of Scripts: The normalization of scripts now covers
  JavaScript

- Improved QA and Unit Testing: The improved QA process now includes
  API testing and new library of test files in various formats that are
  tested on a wide variety of systems (try running 'make check' in the source
  directory)

You may need to run 'ldconfig' after installing this version.

** This version drops the special support for Cygwin. Our QA process showed
** serious problems with ClamAV builds under Cygwin due to some low-level
** incompatibilities in the POSIX compatibility layer, resulting in unreliable
** ClamAV behaviour.

## 0.90

The ClamAV team is proud to announce the long awaited ClamAV 0.90.
This version introduces lots of new interesting features and marks
a big step forward in the development of our antivirus engine.

The most important change is the introduction of scripted updates.
Instead of transferring the whole cvd file at each update, only the
differences between the latest cvds and the previous versions will be
transferred.

In case the local copy of the latest cvd is corrupted or the scripted
update fails for some reason, freshclam will fallback to the old method.
Similarly to cvd files, scripted updates are compressed and digitally signed
and are already being distributed. They will dramatically reduce traffic on
our mirrors and will allow us to release even more updates in the future.

Another noticeable change is the new configuration syntax: you can now turn
single options on and off, the old crude hack of "DisableDefaultScanOptions"
is no longer required.

Cosmetic changes apart, the 0.9x series introduces lots of new code, but some
parts are not compiled in by default because they are not ready for production
systems yet. You are encouraged to pass the --enable-experimental flag to
./configure when compiling ClamAV. The experimental code introduces many
improvements in terms of detection rate and performances. If you find a bug,
please take some time to report it on our bugzilla: https://bugzilla.clamav.net.
Your help in testing the new code is really appreciated. The experimental code
introduces many improvements in terms of detection rate and performances. 

RAR3, SIS and SFX archives support is finally available together with 
new unpackers and decryptors: pespin, sue, yc, wwpack32, nspack, mew, upack
and others. Additionally, ClamAV now includes better mechanisms for scanning
ELF, PDF and tar files. The email decoding has been improved to reduce both
the memory requirements and the time taken to process attachments.

As part of the Google Summer of Code program, we have introduced support for
a new phishing signatures format that has proved very effective in detecting
phishing emails. The ClamAV phishing module allows better and more generic
detection of phishing emails by searching for URLs in email messages, and 
comparing the real site with the URL displayed to the user in the message. 

On the performance side, support for the MULTISCAN command has been 
implemented in clamd, allowing to scan multiple files simultaneously.
Support for Sensory Networks' NodalCore acceleration technology
(https://www.clamav.net/nodalcore/) is now available in ClamAV and will be
compiled in if the ncore libraries are detected at compile time. NodalCore
acceleration allows highly improved scan speeds on systems equipped with
NodalCore cards.

The ClamAV team (https://www.clamav.net/about.html#credits)

## 0.81

Scan engine improvements were made. The internal mail scanner now supports
multipart/partial messages, and support for decoding non-standard mail files
was greatly enhanced. clamav-milter by default uses libclamav and scans emails
itself without the use of clamd. libclamav can now extract RFC2397 encoded
data within HTML documents, block zip archives with modified information in
local header, and scan HQX files. PE file structure rebuilding from compressed
executables was improved.

Important note to clamdwatch users: please upgrade to the latest version
(contrib/clamdwatch) as soon as possible.

- libclamav:
  - major improvements in the mail scanning engine:
  - support for multipart/partial messages
  - improved support for non-standard quoted-printable attachments
  - in some situations it will try to guess a correct mode (e.g.
    a good type for an incorrect content-type, a best guess for an
    unknown encoding type, etc.)
  - handling of RFC822 comments in the commands (e.g.: Co(foo)ntent-Type:
    text/plain)
  - better recovery if memory softlimit is hit
  - new test code that decodes emails without parsing them first (must
    be enabled manually before compilation)

    - support for extracting RFC2397 encoded data within HTML documents
    - blocking of zip archives with modified information in local header
    - improved PE structure rebuilding from compressed executables
    - improved support for zip archives
    - support for Mac's HQX file format
    - stability and (minor) security fixes
    - a lot of minor improvements, including support for new platforms

- clamd:
  - new directive ExitOnOOM (stop the deamon when libclamav reports an out of
    memory condition)
  - new directives StreamMinPort and StreamMaxPort (port range specification
    for a stream mode)
  - support for passing of file descriptors

- clamdscan:
  - added support for --move and --remove

- clamav-milter:
  - by default uses libclamav to scan e-mails
  - new option --external (enables the use of clamd)
  - various optimizations

- freshclam:
  - the DNS mode is now enabled by default (no need for DNSDatabaseInfo in
    freshclam.conf)
  - --no-dns uses a If-Modified-Since method instead of a range GET
  - added support for AllowSupplementaryGroups

- sigtool:
  - new options --vba and --vba-hex (extract VBA/Word6 macros and optionally
    display the corresponding hex values; Word6 binary code will be
    disassembled)

- The list of third party programs with support for ClamAV is growing
  rapidly. Here are the latest additions (see clamdoc.pdf for details):

  - AVScan - a libclamav based GUI a-v scanner for Unix

## 0.80

Stable version. Please read the release notes for the candidate versions below.

--
The ClamAV team (https://www.clamav.net/about.html#credits)

## 0.80rc4

Improvements in this release include better JPEG exploit verification,
faster base64 decoding, support for GNU tar files, updated on-access scanner,
and others.

--
The ClamAV team (https://www.clamav.net/about.html#credits)

## 0.80rc3

This release candidate eliminates possible false positive alerts in UPX/FSG
compressed files and clarifies behaviour of default actions in clamd and
freshclam.

We encourage users to take advantage of our new mirror structure. In order to
download the database from the closest mirror you should configure freshclam
to use db.XY.clamav.net where XY is your country code (see
http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm for the full list). Please add
the following lines to freshclam.conf:

    DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
    DatabaseMirror db.XY.clamav.net
    DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net

DNSDatabaseInfo enables database and software version verification through
DNS TXT records, and the second database mirror acts as a fallback in case
a connection to the first mirror fails for some reason.

## 0.80rc2

This update fixes a serious bug in e-mail scanner.

## 0.80rc

The development version of ClamAV is ready for general testing! New mechanisms
have already proved very nasty to Internet worms successfully protecting
against the new versions R, S, T, U, V and W of the infamous Mydoom worm
and detecting them as Worm.Mydoom.Gen before they were analysed and specific
signatures added by the ClamAV database maintainers. That means servers running
the new version of ClamAV have detected and blocked 100% of Mydoom attacks!

New features in this release include:

- libclamav
  - Portable Executable analyser (CL_SCAN_PE) featuring:
  - UPX decompression (all versions)
  - Petite decompression (2.x)
  - FSG decompression (1.3, 1.31, 1.33)
  - detection of broken executables (CL_SCAN_BLOCKBROKEN)
  - new, memory efficient, pattern matching algorithm (multipattern variant
    of Boyer-Moore) - it's now primary matcher and Aho-Corasick is only used
    for regular expression extended signatures
  - new signature format with advanced target type and offset specification
  - support for MD5 based signatures
  - extended regular expression scanner
  - added support for MS cabinet files
  - added support for CHM files

  - new method of mail files detection
  - all e-mail attachments are now scanned (previously only the first ten
    attachments were scanned)
  - added support for scanning URLs in e-mails (CL_SCAN_MAILURL)
  - detection of Worm.Mydoom.M.log
  - updated API (still backward compatible but please consult clamdoc.pdf
    (Section 6) and adapt your software)

- clamd
  - new directive ScanHTML (enables HTML normalisator and ScrEnc decoder)
  - new directive ScanPE (win32 executable analyser and decompressor)
  - new directive DetectBrokenExecutables (try to detect broken executables
    and mark them as Broken.Executable)
  - new directive MailFollowURLs (try to download and scan files from URLs
    in mails. BE CAREFUL! DO NOT ENABLE IT ON LOADED MAIL SERVERS)
  - new directive ArchiveBlockMax (archives that exceed limits will be
    marked as viruses)
  - clamav.conf was renamed clamd.conf

- clamscan
  - mail files are scanned by default, use --no-mail to disable it
  - new option --no-html (disables HTML normalisator)
  - new option --no-pe (disables PE analyser)
  - new option --detect-broken
  - new option --block-max
  - new option --mail-follow-urls (download and scan files from URLs in mails)

- clamdscan
  - now prints warnings if some activated command line options are only
    supported by clamscan
  - added support for archive scanning in stdin mode

- clamav-milter
  - improved template file format
  - quarantined file names now contain virus names
  - initial support for SESSION mode of clamd

- freshclam:
  - new directive DNSDatabaseInfo that enables ultra lightweight version
    verification method through DNS (using TXT records). Based on idea by
    Christopher X. Candreva and enabled by default.
    (see http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/clamav/users/11102)
  - new option --no-dns (quick option to disable DNS method without editing
    freshclam.conf)

- sigtool
  - removed ability of automatic signature generation (use MD5 sums to
    create your own signatures, see signatures.pdf for details)
  - new option --md5
  - new option --html-normalise (saves HTML normalisation and decryption
    results in three html files in current directory)

- configure:
  - new option --disable-gethostbyname_r (try enabling it if clamav-milter
    compilation fails)
  - new option --disable-dns (try enabling it if freshclam compilation fails)
  - extended regular expression scanner

- documentation
  - included new Mac OS X installation instructions
  - official documentation rewritten and outdated docs removed

- new 3rd party software with support for ClamAV:

Special thanks to aCaB for his work on UPX, FSG and Petite decompressors.

Thanks to good reaction times on new threats ClamAV was awarded as best
security tool for 2004 by Linux Journal: "...With this year's outbreak of
e-mail worms for non-Linux platforms, ClamAV has been getting quite a workout,
and Linux admins on mailing lists report that database update times are keeping
up with or beating the proprietary alternatives." Thanks!

## 0.75

This release fixes detection of e-mails generated by Worm.Mydoom.I.

Important notice for people using ClamAV 0.60:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our logs show that there is still a small percentage of ClamAV 0.60
installations updating their database. ClamAV 0.60 was released on
July 29th, 2003 and it was the last release to use the old database
format. Starting from version 0.65, released on November 12nd, ClamAV
uses a new database format, which is compressed and digitally signed.
We have been distributing the database in both formats till now, but
we plan to drop support for ClamAV 0.60 on September 1st.

We encourage _all_ users to upgrade to the latest release available.
People running an old version of ClamAV are missing many viruses and 
may experience stability problems.

On non-production systems you can try the latest development version.
The new engine not only speeds up the scanning process but also limits
memory usage by about 8 MB ! It's able to scan new formats, including
CAB, CHM, UPX, HTML (normalisation), PowerPoint macros and can detect
annoying e-mails with empty attachments generated by new Bagle variants.

Thanks to the help of many companies we have 49 very fast and reliable
virus database mirrors in 22 regions and the number is still growing.
As of March 2004 we attempt to redirect our users to the closest pool
of mirrors by looking at their ip source address when they try to resolve
database.clamav.net. Our DNS servers can answer with a CNAME to:
db.europe.clamav.net, db.america.clamav.net, db.asia.clamav.net or
db.other.clamav.net. Our advanced push-mirroring mechanism (maintained by
Luca Gibelli) allows database maintainers to update all the mirrors in less
than one minute !

There will be no major feature enhancements in the 0.7x series. Our work
will be concentrated on a new scanning engine and preliminary heuristics -
please help us and test CVS snapshots from time to time.

We are happy to announce new programs with support for ClamAV (all of them
have been reviewed by our team - more info in the documentation and

has better Cygwin support.

## 0.66

This version is a response to the "clamav 0.65 remote DOS exploit" information
published on popular security-related mailing lists. Unfortunately we had
not been contacted by the author before he published that and had to release
this (unplanned) package very quickly (it should be mentioned that CVS version
was not vulnerable to the exploit). Untested code has been disabled also
the Dazuko support is temporarily not available (if you really need it please
use a CVS version or wait for a next stable release). Other noteworthy changes:

- clamd:
  - fixed database timestamp handling (and a double reload problem reported
    by Alex Pleiner and Ole Stanstrup)

News:

ClamAV was the first anti-virus protecting against Worm.SCO.A (aka MyDoom.A) !
The signature was published by Diego d'Ambra in the daily update 105,
26-Jan-2004 20:23 GMT and we were at least two hours faster than "big" AV
vendors:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3764826&forum_id=34654
http://www.pcwelt.de/news/viren_bugs/37278/4.html

clamav-devel is finally able to decode OLE2 (Microsoft Office) files and
decompress VBA streams ! The code is developed by Trog, official ClamAV
developer. Also we're testing new clamd implementation that will solve
several important problems (especially that "Time out" related). Please
help us and test the latest CVS version.

The virus database now contains more than 20.000 signatures ! On January 8,
Denis De Messemacker (who joined our team 3 months ago) added signatures for
about 7700 new viruses. Also special thanks go to Tomasz Papszun for his
hard work on daily submissions and forcing us to keep ClamAV quality on
the highest possible level.

New mirroring mechanisms. Luca Gibelli (ClamAV) and mirror administrators
(22 sites) are converting mirrors to new "push mirroring"
method. It uses advanced techniques to ensure all the mirrors are up to date.

## 0.60

Hello again...

This is a new, (very?) stable release of Clam AntiVirus. 0.60 was developed
and stabilized for over seven months and many people had contributed to the
final release. This version introduces many enhancements and a new program:
clamav-milter written by ClamAV developer Nigel Horne. This is a mail scanner
for Sendmail/milter written entirely in C, which uses clamd for virus scanning.
Clamav-milter and clamd duet is a powerful solution for systems where high
performance is required. Please check clamdoc for more detail.

    Many people get confused with ClamAV database status because of
    the OpenAntiVirus update information at:
    http://openantivirus.org/latest.php
    (last update at 17 October, 2002). The ClamAV virus database contains
    the OAV database (with some signatures fixed or removed) but we
    develop it independently of the OAV project. Our database is updated
    frequently (on average 4-5 times a week). You can help (or join) us -
    will find some basic but useful instructions at
    http://clamav.elektrapro.com/doc/signatures.pdf

News from ClamAV world:

- New email address for virus submitting: virus@clamav.elektrapro.com
   You don't need to encrypt a virus sample, but if your system doesn't allow
   you to send infected files just put it into an encrypted zip archive
   (password: virus)

   Special thanks to Nicholas Chua, Diego D'Ambra, Hrvoje Habjanic, Nigel Kukard
   and Chris van Meerendonk for a big number of samples submitted.

- New mailing list: virusdb@clamav.elektrapro.com
   After each update an email with subject "[clamav-virusdb] Update" and a list
   of viruses added is sent to it. You can set up a procmail rule for freshclam
   to react on such a mails (and update the database just after an update).

- New official mirrors:
  - clamav.ozforces.com: database mirror updated manually (thanks to
    Andrew <andrew@ozforces.com>)
  - clamav.essentkabel.com: full (automatic) mirror of clamav.elektrapro.com
    (thanks to Chris van Meerendonk <cvm@castel.nl>)
  - clamav.linux-sxs.org: database mirror - rsync from clamav.ozforces.com
    (thanks to Douglas J Hunley <doug@hunley.homeip.net>)

    Freshclam will automatically use them when the main server is not
    accessible.

- Official port in FreeBSD available ! (maintained by Masahiro Teramoto
   <markun@onohara.to>)

- Unofficial port for OpenBSD is available at:
	http://www.activeintra.net/openbsd/article.php?id=5
  (maintained by Flinn Mueller <flinn@activeintra.net>)

- there are many new programs that use ClamAV, eg. mod_clamav (Apache
  virus scanning filter), clamdmail or Sagator. You will find more
  info in clamdoc.

Changes:

- libclamav:
  - fixed buffer overflow in unrarlib (patch by Robbert Kouprie
    <robbert@exx.nl>)

  - various mbox code updates (fixed memory leak; added support for decoding
    viruses sent in message bodies, detection of viruses that put their
    payloads after the end of message marker (thanks to Stephen White
    <stephen@earth.li> for the bug report and useful CGI tools); 

  - zziplib updated to 0.10.81 (some problems with older version were reported
    by Martin Schitter)
  - direct scanning of mbox/maildir files (new directive CL_MAIL)
  - file scanner optimization (patch by Hendrik Muhs
    <Hendrik.Muhs@student.uni-magdeburg.de>)
  - bzip2 support
  - faster detection of malformed Zip archives (eg. 'Zip of Death'), they are
    reported as a viruses
  - fixed strcasecmp() compile problem in zziplib on Free/NetBSD and others

- clamd:
  - fixed descriptor leak in directory scanner - it was causing random
    clamd crashes and locks, especially on highly loaded servers. Reported
    by Kristof Petr <Kristof.P@fce.vutbr.cz>.

  - fixed crash with archive scanning on BSD (increased thread stack size)
    (Nigel Horne)
  - fixed CONTSCAN command (used by clamdscan) - it had archive support
    disabled (hardcoded)
  - fixed SelfCheck option (there was a logic bug, and the option was
    disabled) it now checks a databases time stamps and reloads them
    if needed.
  - fixed possible writing to undefined descriptors (bug found by
    Brian May <bam@debian.org>)
  - new STREAM command (scanning data on socket) and directives:
    StreamSaveToDisk (save stream to disk to allow scanning within archives),
    StreamMaxLength. This option allows scanning data on socket (might be
    sent from another host), currently only clamav-milter uses this.

  - new ScanMail directive for scanning into mbox/Maildir files
  - new directive: ArchiveLimitMemoryUsage (limit memory usage with bzip2)
  - new directive: AllowSupplementaryGroups (feature requested by Exiscan
    users)
  - syslog support (LogSyslog) (patch by Hrvoje Habjanic
    <hrvoje.habjanic@zg.hinet.hr>)
  - fixed parser segfault with extra space between option and argument
    in config file (Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)

- clamscan:
  - fixed --remove option (didn't work when the file was scanned with an
    internal unpacker) (patch by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
  - --move option for moving infected files into a specified directory
    (by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
  - --mbox enables a direct support for mbox files
    (ex. clamscan --mbox /var/spool/mail)
  - fixed --log (-l) option
  - fixed -i option (patch by Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)
  - enabled default archive limits (max-files = 500, max-size = 10M,
    max-recursion = 5)
  - use arj instead of non-free unarj (patch by Magnus Ekdahl)
  - use unzoo instead of non-free zoo (patch by Magnus Ekdahl)
  - removed thread support

freshclam:
  - mirror support (implemented by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
  - --proxy-user: proxy authorization support (implemented by Gernot Tenchio
    <g.tenchio@telco-tech.de>)
  - new options --on-error-execute, --on-update-execute
    (ex. freshclam -d -c 6 --on-error-execute "sendsms 23332243 Can't
    update virus database"). Idea by Douglas J Hunley <doug@hunley.homeip.net>

configure:
  - --disable-cr (don't link with C reentrant library (needed on some newer
    versions of OpenBSD))

- Enhanced AIX (thanks to Mike Loewen <mloewen@sturgeon.cac.psu.edu>) and
   Tru64 support (thanks to Christophe Varoqui <ext.devoteam.varoqui@sncf.fr>)

- documentation:
  - included how-to in Portugese by Alexandre de Jesus Marcolino
  - clamdoc.pdf and system manual updates

Many thanks to Luca 'NERvOus' Gibelli from ElektraPro for his support,
to Ken McKittrick from USA DataNet for a fully accessible FreeBSD box and
to mailing list subscribers for a constructive discussions.

## 0.54

Many major changes this time...

- libclamav:
  - fixed segfault with some strange zip archives (there is a bug in zziplib,
    libclamav contains a work around for it) (the problem was reported by
    Oliver Paukstadt <pstadt@stud.fh-heilbronn.de>)
  - engine improvements (better support for a detection of new viruses,
    limited memory usage (consumes ~ 5 Mb now))
  - mbox code updated and moved into the library: fixed core dump when an
    embedded message includes a mime header with the line Content-Type:
    without specifying the type of content, fixed (theoretical) memory leak,
    support for multipart/report messages, fixed bug causing some formats to
    fail to scan) (Nigel)
- clamd:
  - new commands: CONTSCAN (it doesn't stop scanning even when virus is
    found), VERSION
  - disable logging of a unnecessary time stamps with LogTime when
    LogVerbose isn't used (patch by Ed Phillips <ed@UDel.Edu>)
- freshclam:
  - "Cache-Control: no-cache" enabled by default
  - Cygwin support fix
- clamdscan:
  - initial version
- all tools:
  - removed huge printf() in help() (there was a buffer overflow problem with
    --help option under Windows and SCO Unix (reported by Wojciech Noworyta
    <wnow@konarski.edu.pl> and Nigel respectively)
- configure:
  - allow configuration of the clamav user and group with --with-user and
    --with-group (patch by Patrick Bihan-Faou <patrick@mindstep.com>)
  - --enable-id-check - it uses the check procedure from Jason Englander
    <jason@englanders.cc>, currently it will fail on systems with getent
    which doesn't detect clamav group.
  - do not overwrite the existing config file

There are initial packages for Windows available at:
    http://clamav.elektrapro.com/binary

--tk

## 0.53

This release has removed the limit for a file name length in clamscan. Some
viruses (eg. W32/Yaha.E) are using very long file names, and they were
ignored in mbox mode. Users of AMaViS-ng and other wrappers were not
vulnerable to this problem, because that programs don't use original
attachement file names.

- clamscan:
  - removed limit for a file name length (thanks to Odhiambo Washington
    <wash@wananchi.com> for the test files and extensive mbox testing)
  - mbox: adapted to the new changes, enabled thread support (Nigel),
    re-enabled temporary directory removing.

## 0.52

This version contains a portability fixes - it should compile on OpenBSD,
MacOSX and NetBSD (support for them was broken in 0.51). 

- clamd: various fixes:
  - drop supplementary groups (suggested by Enrico Scholz
    <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>) (this has been implemented
    in freshclam, too)
  - work-around for the segmentation fault at QUIT under FreeBSD
  - check timeouts when waiting for threads in RELOAD mode
  - SelfCheck - internal integrity check (by default every 1 hour)
  - fixed problem with directory scanning on non typical file systems
    (bug reported by Jason Englander <jason@englanders.cc>)
  - clamd is a system command (clamd.1 -> clamd.8, /usr/local/bin ->
    /usr/local/sbin) (Magnus Ekdahl)
- clamscan:
  - mbox code updates (Nigel Horne) - it fixes some problems on *BSD
    systems (see mailing lists archives for the details)
  - enable core dumping (Nigel Horne) [ with --enable-debug ]
- freshclam:
  - applied http-proxy patch from http://bugs.debian.org/clamav (by
    Martin Lesser <admin-debian@bettercom.de>)
  - when configured with --disable-cache, freshclam forces 'no-cache'
    option in proxy servers (patch by Ant La Porte <ant@dvere.net>)

- HPUX (10.20/11.0 tested) support (thanks to Joe Oaks <joe.oaks@hp.com>)
- fixed support for SCO Unix and BeOS (Nigel Horne)
- support/mboxscan: new version with SpamAssassin support (Nigel Horne)
- re-included TrashScan 0.08 (by Trashware <trashware@gmx.de>) - the security
  issue has been fixed.
- included "Installing qmail-scanner, Clam Antivirus and SpamAssassin under
  FreeBSD" how-to by Paul Hoadley and Eric Parsonage

## 0.51

OAV database is up to date ! There was a problem with signature parsing,
because some hex strings were upper case. Anyway, I still recommend you
freshclam for a database updating.

- support for the genuine OAV database
- limited memory usage (at the cost of speed, increase CL_MIN_LENGTH in
  libclamav/clamav.h to make it faster, it's safe to set it on 3-4 for
  the OAV database)
- fixed compile problem on TurboLinux 6.5 (probably others, too), the bug
  was reported by Henk Kuipers <henk@opensourcesolutions.nl>.
- clamd: fixed THREXIT (thanks to Piotr Gackiewicz <gacek@intertele.pl>)
- clamd: fixed serious bug with thread argument type
- clamscan: mbox: don't scan empty attachments (Nigel Horne)
- configure: --with-db1, --with-db2 (suggested by Magnus Ekdahl)

## 0.50

Here it is...
Clam AntiVirus 0.50 contains an anti-virus library - libclamav, a fully
multi-threaded daemon clamd(1) and a quite long list of changes. The
documentation was rewritten and you _should_ review it. By courtesy of
NERvOus <nervous@nervous.it> and ElektraPro, there are three mailing lists
available - you can subscribe via www at http://clamav.elektrapro.com/ml.
Please check the manual for more information.

New software:

- libclamav with RAR, Zip and Gzip support built-in. The library is thread
  safe and should be very secure, also. It uses UniquE RAR File
  Library by Christian Scheurer and Johannes Winkelmann (RAR 2.0 support only)
  and zziplib library by Guido Draheim and Tomi Ollila. Both of them are
  included and slightly modified in the clamav sources. You need the zlib
  library for the Zip/Gzip support, though. The API is described with
  examples in the clamdoc.

- clamd: a modern anti-virus daemon. It uses configuration file clamav.conf
  described in the clamav.conf(5) manual. The program was written with
  security as a goal. 

- clamuko: on-access scanning under Linux. It utilizes Dazuko kernel module
  (GPL, http://dazuko.org) and is clamd-based.

New features / improvements:

- enhanced scanner engine (better detection of some complex polymorphic
  viruses)

- clamscan: Nigel Horne <njh@bandsman.co.uk> has added the ability to scan
  mail attachments in a filter. For example:

  $ clamscan -i --mbox - < /var/spool/mail/john
  /tmp/aa6b9fc06bc477ae/setup.exe: Worm/Klez.H FOUND

  Nigel is the author of the whole mbox code in clamscan. Currently it only
  works in a filter mode, but there are plans to move the code into the
  libclamav and allow clamd using it. Please check support/mboxscan, also.

- clamscan: support for including and excluding multiple patterns with
  --include and --exclude (patch by Alejandro Dubrovsky
  <s328940@student.uq.edu.au>).
  Example: clamscan --include .exe --include .obj --include .scr /mnt/windows

- clamscan: don't scan /proc files (Linux, st_dev comparing). No more
  /proc/kcore related mails :))

- clamscan: use libclamav's archive support by default (it's enabled by default
  and may be disabled with --disable-archive) and switch to the external
  unpackers (if specified) in the case of libclamav archive code error.

- freshclam: proxy support (via $http_proxy variable and --http-proxy).
  I started implementing proxy support some time ago, but never finished.
  Nigel Horne did the great job and has finished the proxy support !

- freshclam: --daemon-notify. freshclam will send the RELOAD command to the
  daemon after database update (supports both tcp and local sockets, it reads
  clamav.conf to determine the socket type).

- freshclam: support for viruses.db2

Bug fixes:

- freshclam: log 'Database updated' message (thanks to Jeffrey Moskot
  <jef@math.miami.edu> for the bug report). It now prints a number
  of signatures in a database, also.

- clamscan: fixed compile problem on Solaris 8 and some other systems -
  #include <signal.h> lack in others.c (thanks Mike Loewen
  <mloewen@sturgeon.cac.psu.edu> for the bug report)

Documentation:

- included Japanese documentation by Masaki Ogawa <proc@mac.com>

- updated Spanish "Sendmail + Amavis + ClamAv - Como" by Erick I. Lopez
   Carreon <elopezc@technitrade.com>

- rewritten clamdoc, included clamdoc-html, removed PostScript version (.ps)

- Clam-Mutant ;) logo update by Michal Hajduczenia <michalis@mat.uni.torun.pl>

- new man pages: clamd(1), clamav.conf(5); others updated

!!!
    Please don't use the oav-update script with this version. It doesn't
update viruses.db2 and supports OpenAntiVirus.org site only (the last
update of the OAV database was 1 July !). Nicholas Chua <nicholas@ncmbox.net>
has generated over 200 new signatures, ClamAV's database is also frequently
updated (expecially when new wild virus/worm appears, eg. W32/BugBear.A).

    This software is still in developement (new software == new bugs), however
clamscan should be very stable. You shouldn't use clamd/clamuko (well, clamd is
stable, clamuko isn't) on production systems, yet. Please wait for 0.51 at
least ;). ClamAV 0.50 was tested on Linux and Solaris and should work fine.
There is a problem with clamd on FreeBSD (tested on my FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT) -
the daemon crashes with Zip/Gzip files (disabling ScanArchive should help).

Enjoy !

## 0.24

- fixed threads deadlock in a critical error situation (bug found by David
  Sanchez <dsanchez@veloxia.com>)
- fixed sigtool bug (negative seeking)
- fixed potential clamscan segfault in the case of memory allocation error
- unpacker execution error is no longer treated as critical - a few programs
  (eg. Qmail-Scanner, TrashScan) have clamscan command hardcoded with all
  archive options turned on. Now, if unpacker can't be executed, raw file is
  scanned and scan process is continued.
- reverted to pthread.h detection
- TrashScan 0.07 (Trashware <trashware@gmx.net>)
- --exclude (regular expressions are not supported !)
  [ex: clamscan --exclude="/proc/kcore" /], but please use it with care.
- included html documentation

IMPORTANT NOTE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will probably have a problem with a default Qmail-Scanner (1.13 or newer)
installation. You need to increase qmail-smtpd softlimit or disable it. You
can force clamscan to use only half of the memory which it uses by default, too.
Please change the following line in the clamscan/matcher.h file:
    #define MIN_LENGTH 5
to:
    #define MIN_LENGTH 3
and recompile the program. Unhappily, scanning may be a little slower in some
cases, but it shouldn't be significant. Then you can safely set the qmail
softlimit to 8 MB. I want to thank Doug Monroe <doug@planetconnect.com> for
his contribution in the problem analysis.
---

New ClamAV version is in a heavy development. It has currently built-in
support for RAR, Zip, Gzip and tar. The daemon will support only built-in
compression/archive support. Snapshot will be available for a few days.

## 0.23

- fixed compile problem on FreeBSD (thanks to Wieslaw Glod <wkg@x2.pl> and
  Ken McKittrick <klmac@usadatanet.com>)
- clamscan reads all .db files from data directory, so you can put your
  own databases there and they won't be overwrited by the updaters. viruses.db
  is still the main database file (if --database isn't used).
- --deb (debian binary packages scanning) by Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>
- --remove option, but be careful with it !
- new clam logo ;) (GPL) by Michal Hajduczenia <michalis@mat.uni.torun.pl>.
- TrashScan 0.06 (by Trashware <trashware@gmx.net>) - a script for scanning
  mail with procmail. I recommend it. (support/trashscan)
- documentation updates

0.30 release will contain a daemon and an anti-virus library (with simple API),
so you can use it directly in your projects. I want to build in zip and rar
support, also.

There are binary packages for AIX available. Please check the documentation.

## 0.22

This release fixes bug with scanning archives in unaccessible directories with
*superuser* priviledges (after dropping priviledges scanner wasn't able to
access the archive, although the same archive was accessible), thanks
for Sergei Pronin <sp@finndesign.fi> for the problem description. Now all
archives unaccessible directly by the clamav user are copied (with a respect to
--max-space) to the temporary directory. All old filesystem tricks were removed.

Other fixes / improvements:

- better error handling, new error codes
- improved -i (--infected) option
- removed --strange-unzip option
- removed eicar test files and logos from the documentation due to the GPL
  (thanks for Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>), ClamAV-Test-Signature is
  used instead
- removed Qmail-Scanner patch, ClamAV is supported by Q-S 1.13 (thanks guys!)
- code cleanups

## 0.21 Release

It fixes following problems:

- database downloading in freshclam/0.20
- malformed amavis-perl patch from 0.20
- clamscan problems with some unzip versions, please try --strange-unzip
  option

ClamAV 0.21 source package contains initial support for NetBSD
(thanks to Marc Baudoin <babafou@babafou.eu.org>, Jean-Edouard BABIN
<Jeb@jeb.com.fr>), better support for Mac OS X (Masaki Ogawa <proc@mac.com>),
and clamdoc documentation corrected by Dennis Leeuw <dleeuw@made-it.com>.

## 0.20 Release

The most important change in this release is a new, linear pattern matching
algorithm. You will find more informations about it in clamscan/matcher.c -
in the sources and in clamdoc. Summary (since 0.15):

New features:

- fast pattern matching algorithm
- sigtool utility, check `man sigtool` and clamdoc
- Linux: threads autodetection on various architectures
  (Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)
- -i, --infected: clamscan prints only infected files
- 'Data scanned' in summary, size in megabytes with 16 Kb precision
- configure: --with-dbdir sets the database location
- support/sigmake shell script by Dennis Leeuw <leeuw@stone-it.com>
- Spanish "Sendmail+Amavis+ClamAv installation how-to" by
  Erick I. Lopez Carreon <elopezc@technitrade.com>

Updates:

- "Debian GNU/Linux Mail Server v. 0.2.0" by Dennis Leeuw <leeuw@stone-it.com>
- qmail-scanner patch from Kazuhiko <kazuhiko@fdiary.net>
- general documentation cleanups / updates
- freshclam / Internet database location

Fixes:

- threads autodetection on not-x86 Linux systems
- gcc 3.x support (David Ford <david+cert@blue-labs.org>)
- data type fix on Mac OS X (Peter N Lewis <peter@stairways.com.au>)
- removed -w, --whole-file, now clamscan scans whole files by default
  -w is still supported by internal getopt(), because it is used in
  various patches
- removed --one-virus, still supported by getopt(); removed 'Found viruses'
  from summary, clamscan stops file scanning after first virus
- fixed old problem with scanning stdin
- removed amavisd-patch - strange problems have been reported

OpenAntiVirus Update is a great tool written by Matthew A. Grant
<grantma@anathoth.gen.nz> and it will be the primary updater for ClamAV
in the near future. In contrast to freshclam it has proxy support and many
specific features. Please check clamdoc for more informations and how to
obtain it.

## 0.15 Notes

This version contains minor bugfixes only, such as:
- multiple fixes in freshclam (it has problems, when one of the
  hosts wasn't accessible), there were logic flaws in the code
- fixed problem with password protected archives (unpackers were waiting
  for password)

New features:
- OpenBSD support (thanks to Kamil Andrusz <wizz@mniam.net>)
- added support for amavisd, qmail-scanner (see ./support)

There were no major bugs and I was very busy, that's why new version is
released just today. In the next 2 months, clamav development will be much
faster. Here are some of my plans:

~ 0.20 : New pattern-matching algorithm
~ 0.30 : clamlib; clamscan and the daemon based on it

There is a new homepage:
- http://clamav.elektrapro.com

Thanks to ElektraPro.com for sponsoring this site (it's very fast).
Thanks to NERvOus <nervous@nervous.it>.

If you are interested in current development versions, please check
snapshots link.

### Resource usage limits in 0.14

Two new features: --max-files, --max-space have been implemented. If you have
enabled one of this options, clamscan monitors resource usage (number of
created files and used space) and stops extractor when it has exceeded
the limit. You should use these options to protect your machine against
Denial of Service attacks. In the near future --max-levels (limit for
recursive archives extracting) and --max-time (spent on checking/extracting
files) will be implemented.

### FreeBSD: AMaViS compile problems

Please check FAQ.

### !!! Strange signatures in VirusSignatures-2002.04.15.10.51.zip !!!

Last version of signatures was ~90 kb, this version is ~474 kb.
But I don't understand, why some signatures are mega-huge. When I decoded
them, they looked like regular files. In CA they were removed from the
database and I probably add them later, in normal sizes.

### Installation :

Please view documentation in ./docs. There are several formats - pdf, ps
and plain latex, if you want to compile it yourself.

You need GNU make (on Solaris you should have gmake).
It was tested only with gcc 2.9x compilers.
