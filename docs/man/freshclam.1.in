.LP 
freshclam updates the virus database. It's a part of the Clam AntiVirus package. It requires an Internet connection.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
Freshclam reads its configuration from freshclam.conf. The settings can be overwritten with command line options.
.TP 
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Output help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print version number and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose. This option causes freshclam to print many additional informations.
.TP 
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
Be quiet \- output only error messages.
.TP 
\fB\-\-stdout\fR
Write all messages to the standard output (stdout), instead of the standard error output (stderr).
.TP 
\fB\-l FILE, \-\-log=FILE\fR
Save download report in FILE.
.TP 
\fB\-\-datadir=DIRECTORY\fR
Install new database in DIRECTORY. The directory must be writable for the 'clamav' user or unprivileged user running freshclam.
.TP 
\fB\-u USER, \-\-user USER\fR
Run as USER. By default (when started by root) freshclam drops privileges and works as the 'clamav' user.
.TP 
\fB\-d, \-\-daemon\fR
Run in a daemon mode. This option requires \-\-checks.
\fB\-p FILE, \-\-pid=FILE\fR
Save daemon's pid in FILE.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-dns\fR
This option forces old non\-DNS verification method (without a TTL delay).
.TP 
\fB\-c #n, \-\-checks=#n\fR
Check #n times per day for a new database. #n must be between 1 and 50.
.TP 
\fB\-\-daemon\-notify=/path/to/clamd.conf\fR
Notify the daemon about the new database. By default it reads a hardcoded config file but you can use an another one. Both local and TCP sockets are supported.
.TP 
\fB\-a IP, \-\-local\-address=IP\fR
Use (local) IP for HTTP downloads. Useful for multi\-homed systems. If binding fails for whatever reason, a warning is issued and freshclam behaves like without this flag.
.TP 
\fB\-\-on\-error\-execute=COMMAND\fR
Execute COMMAND if error occurred. Remember, that virus database freshness is the most important thing in anti\-virus system. With this option freshclam can alert you (eg. send SMS) when something is going wrong.
.TP 
\fB\-\-on\-update\-execute=COMMAND\fR
Execute COMMAND after successful update.
.TP 
\fB\-\-on\-outdated\-execute=COMMAND\fR
