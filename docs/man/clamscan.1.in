.TP 
\fB\-\-detect\-pua\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-mail\fR
Disable scanning of mail files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-phishing\-sigs\fR
Disable signature-based phishing detection.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-phishing\-scan\-urls\fR
Disable url-based heuristic phishing detection. This disables Phishing.Heuristics.Email.*
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-phishing\-restrictedscan\fR
Enable url-based heuristic phishing detection for all domains (might lead to false positives!).
.TP
\fB\-\-phishing\-ssl\fR

\fB\-\-phishing\-cloak\fR
Always block cloaked URLs (might lead to some false positives).
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-algorithmic\fR
In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide accurate detection. This option disables the algorithmic detection.
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-pe\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. By default ClamAV performs deeper analysis of executable files and attempts to decompress popular executable packers such as UPX, Petite, and FSG. This option \fBdisables\fR PE support and should be used with care!
.TP 
\fB\-\-no\-elf\fR
Executable and Linking Format is a standard format for UN*X executables. This option \fBdisables\fR ELF support.

Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
.TP 
\fB\-\-block\-max\fR
Mark archives as viruses (e.g. RAR.ExceededFileSize, Zip.ExceededFilesLimit) if max\-files, max\-space, or max\-recursion is reached.
.TP 
\fB\-\-mail\-follow\-urls\fR
If an email contains URLs ClamAV can download and scan them. \fBWARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack. Never use it on loaded servers.\fR
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-files=#n\fR
Extract first #n files from each archive. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 500)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-space=#n\fR
Extract first #n kilobytes from each archive. You may pass the value in megabytes in format xM or xm, where x is a number. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 10 MB)
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-recursion=#n\fR
Set archive recursion level limit. This option protects your system against DoS attacks (default: 8).
.TP 
\fB\-\-max\-ratio=#n\fR

.TP 
\fB\-\-unzip[=FULLPATH]\fR
In most cases you don't need this option \- the built\-in unarchiver will extract Zip archives. Howvere, this option may be used as a backup for internal unpacker \- see the full documentation for more information. When enabled without an argument, unzip program will be searched in $PATH. If unzip cannot be found in $PATH, you must force it with =pathname. Remember about '=' between the option and the argument.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unrar[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .rar files. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-arj[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .arj files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-unzoo[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .zoo files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-lha[=FULLPATH]\fR
Scan .lzh files.
.TP 
\fB\-\-jar[=FULLPATH]\fR
clamscan uses unzip for .jar files, so in some cases you may need to pass a full path to unzip. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-deb[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports debian binary packages. Implies \-\-tgz, but doesn't conflict with \-\-tgz=FULLPATH. It requires ar utility.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tar[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports non\-compressed tar archives. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
.TP 
\fB\-\-tgz[=FULLPATH]\fR
This option supports tar.gz and .tgz files. You need GNU tar, on non\-Linux system you probably have it installed as gtar. If it's in $PATH, please use \-\-tgz=gtar in other case please pass a full path. In most cases the unpacker built into libclamav is enough.
