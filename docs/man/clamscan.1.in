clamscan is a command line anti\-virus scanner.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
Most of the options are simple switches which enable or disable some features. Options marked with [=yes/no(*)] can be optionally followed by =yes/=no; if they get called without the boolean argument the scanner will assume 'yes'. The asterisk marks the default internal setting for a given option.

.TP
\fB\-\-heuristic\-scan\-precedence[=yes/no(*)]\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phish it will stop scan immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phish detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected  virus/phish, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first,  the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.

\fB\-\-normalize[=yes(*)/no]\fR
Normalize (compress whitespace, downcase, etc.) html, script, and text files. Use normalize=no for yara compatibility. 
.TP

If you turn off this option, the original files will still be scanned but without additional processing.
