.SH "NAME"
.LP 
clamdtop \- monitor the Clam AntiVirus Daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
clamdtop [options] [clamdspec ...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
clamdtop is a tool to monitor one or multiple clamd(s).
It has a (color) ncurses interface, that shows the jobs in clamd's queue, memory usage, and information about the loaded signature database.
You can specify on the command-line to which clamd(s) it should connect to. By
default it will attempt to connect to the local clamd as defined in clamd.conf.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 

.TP 
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Display help information and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-config\-file=FILE\fR
Read clamd settings from FILE, to determine how to connect to it.
.TP 
\fBclamdspec\fR
Specifies the clamd to connect to: either a path to the local (unix domain) socket of clamd,
or an IP address and an port number (that defaults to 3310) to connect to a
local or remote clamd using TCP/IP.

.SH "OVERVIEW"
.SS KEYS:
.TP
\fBH\fR

Displays a short helpscreen, describing the meaning of various elements on the
display.
.TP
\fBQ\fR

Quits clamdtop
.TP
\fBR\fR

Resets the maximum values.
.TP
\fBup arrow, down arrow\fR

If you are monitoring multiple clamds then clamdtop will show an overview screen by default. You can use the \fBup arrow\fR and \fB down arrow\fR keys to cycle through each clamd individually, and the overview screen.
A blue bar will highlight the clamd that is currently shown in detail. On the overview screen none of the clamds is selected (hence no blue bar), and you can see the items from the queue of all clamds.

.SS The top bar
Shows the version of clamdtop and the current time. Clamdtop updates the display once every 2 seconds.

.SS The list of clamds

Shows the clamds that clamdtop is connected to, and statistics about them.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
.TP 
(1) To connect to the clamd configured in the default clamd.conf:

\fBclamdtop\fR
.TP
(2) To connect to the clamd configured in another clamd.conf:

\fBclamdtop \-\-config\-file=/path/to/clamd.conf

.TP
(3) To connect to a clamd running on another machine (192.168.0.3) on the LAN:

\fBclamdtop 192.168.0.3\fR

.TP
(4) To connect to a clamd running on another machine (192.168.0.3) on a non-default port (3410):

\fBclamdtop 192.168.0.3:3410\fR
.TP
(5) To monitor the local clamd and 2 other remote clamds over TCP/IP:

\fBclamdtop localhost 192.168.0.3 192.168.0.4\fR
.SH "NOTES"
.LP
clamdtop uses colors if the terminal is capable of colors.
If you know your terminal is capable of colors, yet you aren't seeing any, then check
that your \fBTERM\fR environment variable is set correctly.
For example try setting it to TERM=xterm\-color if you are in an xterm-like
environment. IPv6 support has been added. If specifying an IPv6 address, please use the normal IPv6 addressing rules. If specifying both an IPv6 address and a port combination, encapsulate the IPv6 address in square brackets (e.g. [::1]:3410).
.SH "RETURN CODES"
.LP 
0 : Normal termination
.TP 
>0: Error occurred.
