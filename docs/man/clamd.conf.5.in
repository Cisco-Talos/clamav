\fBHeuristicAlerts BOOL\fR
In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide accurate detection. This option controls the algorithmic detection.
.br 
Default: yes
.TP
\fBHeuristicScanPrecedence BOOL\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phishing it will stop scanning immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phishing detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected virus/phishing, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported. Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
