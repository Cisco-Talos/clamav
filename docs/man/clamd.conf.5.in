\fBScanPE BOOL\fR
PE stands for Portable Executable \- it's an executable file format used in all 32 and 64\-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX.

\fBPhishingSignatures BOOL\fR
With this option enabled ClamAV will try to detect phishing attempts by using signatures.

.br
Default: yes
.TP
\fBPhishingAlwaysBlockCloak BOOL\fR
Always block cloaked URLs, even if URL isn't in database. This can lead to false positives.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBPhishingAlwaysBlockSSLMismatch BOOL\fR
Always block SSL mismatches in URLs, even if the URL isn't in the database. This can lead to false positives.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBPartitionIntersection BOOL\fR
Detect partition intersections in raw disk images using heuristics.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBHeuristicScanPrecedence BOOL\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phishing it will stop scanning immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phishing detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected virus/phishing, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported. Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
