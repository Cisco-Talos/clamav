clamd.conf configures the Clam AntiVirus daemon, clamd(8).
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
The file consists of comments and options with arguments. Each line which starts with a hash (\fB#\fR) symbol is ignored by the parser. Options and arguments are case sensitive and of the form \fBOption Argument\fR. The arguments are of the following types:

This feature requires more RAM, so this option is provided in case users are willing to block scans during reload in exchange for lower RAM requirements.
.br
Default: yes
.TP

.RS
.PD 0
.HP 4

In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others), ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide accurate detection. This option controls the algorithmic detection.
.br
Default: yes
.TP
\fBHeuristicScanPrecedence BOOL\fR
Allow heuristic match to take precedence. When enabled, if a heuristic scan (such as phishingScan) detects a possible virus/phishing it will stop scanning immediately. Recommended, saves CPU scan-time. When disabled, virus/phishing detected by heuristic scans will be reported only at the end of a scan. If an archive contains both a heuristically detected virus/phishing, and a real malware, the real malware will be reported. Keep this disabled if you intend to handle "*.Heuristics.*" viruses  differently from "real" malware. If a non-heuristically-detected virus (signature-based) is found first, the scan is interrupted immediately, regardless of this config option.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBScanPE BOOL\fR

Files larger than this limit won't be scanned. Affects the input file itself as well as files contained inside it (when the input file is an archive, a document or some other kind of container). \fBWarning: disabling this limit or setting it too high may result in severe damage to the system. Technical design limitations prevent ClamAV from scanning files greater than 2 GB at this time.\fR
.br

This option specifies a directory (including all files and directories inside it), which should be scanned on access. This option can be used multiple times.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBOnAccessExcludePath STRING\fR
This option allows excluding directories from on-access scanning. It can be used multiple times.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBOnAccessExcludeRootUID BOOL\fR
With this option you can exclude the root UID (0). Processes run under root will be able to access all files without triggering scans or permission denied events.
.br
Note that if clamd cannot check the uid of the process that generated an on-access scan event (e.g., because \fBOnAccessPrevention\fR was not enabled, and the process already exited), clamd will perform a scan.  Thus, setting \fBOnAccessExcludeRootUID\fR is not \fIguaranteed\fR to prevent every access by the root user from triggering a scan (unless \fBOnAccessPrevention\fR is enabled).
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBOnAccessExcludeUID NUMBER\fR
With this option you can exclude specific UIDs. Processes with these UIDs will be able to access all files without triggering scans or permission denied events.
.br
This option can be used multiple times (one per line).
.br
Note: using a value of 0 on any line will disable this option entirely. To exclude the root UID (0) please enable the OnAccessExcludeRootUID option.
.br
Also note that if clamd cannot check the uid of the process that generated an on-access scan event (e.g., because \fBOnAccessPrevention\fR was not enabled, and the process already exited), clamd will perform a scan.  Thus, setting \fBOnAccessExcludeUID\fR is not \fIguaranteed\fR to prevent every access by the specified uid from triggering a scan (unless \fBOnAccessPrevention\fR is enabled).
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBOnAccessExcludeUname STRING\fR
This option allows exclusions via user names when using the on-access scanning client. It can be used multiple times, and has the same potential race condition limitations of the OnAccessExcludeUID option.
.br

Files larger than this value will not be scanned in on access.
.br
Default: 5M
.TP
\fBOnAccessMaxThreads NUMBER\fR
Max number of scanning threads to allocate to the OnAccess thread pool at startup. These threads are the ones responsible for creating a connection with the daemon and kicking off scanning after an event has been processed. To prevent clamonacc from consuming all clamd's resources keep this lower than clamd's max threads.
.br
Default: 5
.TP
\fBOnAccessCurlTimeout NUMBER\fR
Max amount of time (in milliseconds) that the OnAccess client should spend for every connect, send, and recieve attempt when communicating with clamd via curl.
.br

Default: no
.TP
\fBOnAccessPrevention BOOL\fR
Enables fanotify blocking when malicious files are found.
.br
Default: disabled
.TP
\fBOnAccessRetryAttempts NUMBER\fR
Number of times the OnAccess client will retry a failed scan due to connection problems (or other issues).
.br
Default: 0
.TP
\fBOnAccessDenyOnError BOOL\fR
When using prevention, if this option is turned on, any errors that occur during  scanning will result in the event attempt being denied. This could potentially lead to unwanted system behaviour with certain configurations, so the client defaults this to off and prefers allowing access events in case of scan or connection error.
.br
Default: no
.TP
\fBOnAccessExtraScanning BOOL\fR
Toggles extra scanning and notifications when a file or directory is created or moved.
.br
Requires the  DDD system to kick-off extra scans.
.br
