	\item Win32/Cygwin (compiled on XP)
    \end{itemize}
    They're available at \url{http://clamav.or.id/}

    \section{Installation}

    \subsection{Requirements}
    The following elements are required to compile ClamAV:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item zlib and zlib-devel packages
	\item gcc compiler suite (both 2.9x and 3.x are supported)
    \end{itemize}
    The following packages are optional but \textbf{highly recommended}:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item bzip2 and bzip2-devel library
	\item GNU MP 3\\
	It's very important to install the GMP package because it allows
	\verb+freshclam+ to verify the digital signatures of the virus
	databases. If freshclam was compiled without GMP support it will
	display "SECURITY WARNING: NO SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL SIGNATURES" on every
	update. You can download GNU MP at \url{http://www.swox.com/gmp/}\\
	A note for Solaris/SPARC users: you must set the \emph{ABI} system
	variable to 32 (e.g. \verb+setenv ABI 32+) before running the
	configuration script of GMP.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Installing on a shell account}
    To install ClamAV on a shell account (e.g. on some shared host) you
    need not create any additional users or groups. Assuming your
    home directory is \verb+/home/gary+ you should build it as follows:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ ./configure --prefix=/home/gary/clamav --disable-clamav
	$ make; make install
    \end{verbatim}
    To test your installation execute:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ ~/clamav/bin/freshclam
	$ ~/clamav/bin/clamscan ~
    \end{verbatim}
    The \verb+--disable-clamav+ switch disables testing for the existence of
    the \emph{clamav} user and group but \verb+clamscan+ would still require an
    unprivileged account to work in a superuser mode.

    \subsection{Adding new system user and group}
    If you are installing ClamAV for the first time, you have to add a new
    user and group to your system: \footnote{Cygwin note: If you have not
    /etc/passwd you can skip this procedure}
    \begin{verbatim}
	# groupadd clamav
	# useradd -g clamav -s /bin/false -c "Clam AntiVirus" clamav
    \end{verbatim}
    Consult a system manual if your OS has not \emph{groupadd} and
    \emph{useradd} utilities. The account should be locked in
    \emph{/etc/passwd} or \emph{/etc/shadow}.

    \subsection{Compilation of base package}
    Once you have created the clamav user and group, please extract the archive:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ zcat clamav-x.yz.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	$ cd clamav-x.yz
    \end{verbatim}
    Assuming you want to install the configuration files in /etc, configure
    the package as follows:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc
    \end{verbatim}
    Currently \emph{gcc} is required to compile ClamAV.
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ make
	$ su -c "make install"
    \end{verbatim}
    In the last step the software is installed in the /usr/local directory
    and the config file goes to /etc. \textbf{WARNING: Never enable the SUID
    or SGID bits in Clam AntiVirus binaries.}

    \subsection{Compilation with clamav-milter enabled}
    libmilter and its development files are required. To enable clamav-milter,
    configure ClamAV with
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ ./configure --enable-milter
    \end{verbatim}

    \section{Configuration}

    \subsection{clamd}
    If you are going to use the daemon, you have to edit the configuration file
    (in other case \verb+clamd+ won't run):
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ clamd
	ERROR: Please edit the example config file /etc/clamd.conf.
    \end{verbatim}
    This shows the location of the default configuration file. The format and
    options of this file are fully described in the \emph{clamd.conf(5)}
    manual. The config file is well commented and configuration should be
    straightforward.

    \subsubsection{On-access scanning}
    An interesting feature of \verb+clamd+ is on-access scanning based on the
    Dazuko module, available from \url{http://dazuko.org/}. \textbf{It is not
    required to run clamd - furthermore, you shouldn't run Dazuko on production
    systems}. The special thread in \verb+clamd+ responsible for the
    communication with Dazuko is called "Clamuko" (due to the funny name of
    Dazuko) and it's only supported on Linux and FreeBSD. To compile dazuko
    execute:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ tar zxpvf dazuko-a.b.c.tar.gz
	$ cd dazuko-a.b.c
	$ make dazuko
	or
	$ make dazuko-smp (for smp kernels)
	$ su
	# insmod dazuko.o
	# cp dazuko.o /lib/modules/`uname -r`/misc
	# depmod -a
    \end{verbatim}
    Depending on your Linux distribution you have to add a "dazuko" entry to
    \emph{/etc/modules} or run the module during system's startup by adding
    \begin{verbatim}
	modprobe dazuko
    \end{verbatim}
    to some startup file. You must also create a new device:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ cat /proc/devices | grep dazuko
	254 dazuko
	$ su -c "mknod -m 600 /dev/dazuko c 254 0"
    \end{verbatim}
    Now configure Clamuko in \verb+clamd.conf+ and read the \ref{clamuko}
    section.

    \subsection{clamav-milter}
    Nigel Horne's \verb+clamav-milter+ is a very fast email scanner designed for
    Sendmail. It's written entirely in C and only depends on \verb+libclamav+
    or \verb+clamd+. You can find detailed installation instructions in the
    \verb+INSTALL+ file that comes with the clamav-milter sources. Basically,
    to connect it with Sendmail add the following lines to
    \verb+/etc/mail/sendmail.mc+:
    \begin{verbatim}
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clmilter',`S=local:/var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock,
F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `clmilter')
    \end{verbatim}
    If you're running it in \verb+--external+ mode, check entry in
    \verb+clamd.conf+ of the form:
    \begin{verbatim}
	LocalSocket /var/run/clamav/clamd.sock
    \end{verbatim}
    Start clamav-milter
    \begin{verbatim}
	/usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter -lo /var/run/clamav/clmilter.sock
    \end{verbatim}
    and restart sendmail.

    \subsection{Testing}
    Try to scan recursively the source directory:
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ clamscan -r -l scan.txt clamav-x.yz
    \end{verbatim}
    It should find some test files in the clamav-x.yz/test directory.
    The scan result will be saved in the \verb+scan.txt+ log file
    \footnote{To get more info on clamscan options execute 'man clamscan'}.
    To test \verb+clamd+, start it and use \verb+clamdscan+ (or connect directly
    to its socket and run the SCAN command instead):
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ clamdscan -l scan.txt clamav-x.yz
    \end{verbatim}
    Please note that the scanned files must be accessible by the user running
    \verb+clamd+ or you get an error.

    \subsection{Setting up auto-updating}
    \verb+freshclam+ is the default database updater for Clam AntiVirus.
    It can work in two modes:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item interactive - from command line, verbosely
	\item daemon - alone, silently
    \end{itemize}
    When started by a superuser it drops privileges and switches
    to the \emph{clamav} user. \verb+freshclam+ uses the
    \url{database.clamav.net} round-robin DNS which automatically selects
    a database mirror\ref{mirrors}. \verb+freshclam+ is an advanced tool:
    it supports database version verification through DNS, proxy servers (with
    authentication), digital signatures and various error scenarios.
    \textbf{Quick test: run freshclam (as superuser) with no parameters
    and check the output.} If everything is OK you may create the log file in
    /var/log (owned by \emph{clamav} or another user \verb+freshclam+ will be
    running as (\verb+--user+):
    \begin{verbatim}
	# touch /var/log/freshclam.log
	# chmod 600 /var/log/freshclam.log
	# chown clamav /var/log/freshclam.log
    \end{verbatim}
    Now you \emph{should} edit the configuration file (\verb+freshclam.conf+ or
    \verb+clamd.conf+ if they're merged) and configure the
    \emph{UpdateLogFile} directive to point to the created log file.
    Finally, to run \verb+freshclam+ in the daemon mode, execute:
    \begin{verbatim}
	# freshclam -d
    \end{verbatim}
    The other method is to use the \emph{cron} daemon. You have to add the
    following line to the crontab of the \textbf{root} or \textbf{clamav} users:
    {\small
    \begin{verbatim}
N * * * *	/usr/local/bin/freshclam --quiet
    \end{verbatim}}
    \noindent to check for a new database every hour. \textbf{N should be a
    number between 3 and 57 of your choice. Please don't choose any multiple
    of 10, because there are already too many clients using those time slots.}
    Proxy settings are only configurable via the configuration file and
    \verb+freshclam+ will require strict permissions on the config file when
    \verb+HTTPProxyPassword+ is enabled.
    \begin{verbatim}
	HTTPProxyServer myproxyserver.com
	HTTPProxyPort 1234
	HTTPProxyUsername myusername
	HTTPProxyPassword mypass
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsection{Closest mirrors}
    The \verb+DatabaseMirror+ directive in the config file specifies the
    database server \verb+freshclam+ will attempt (up to \verb+MaxAttempts+
    times) to download the database from. The default database mirror
    is \url{database.clamav.net} but multiple directives are allowed.
    In order to download the database from the closest mirror you should  
    configure \verb+freshclam+ to use \url{db.xx.clamav.net} where xx
    represents your country code. For example, if your server is in "Ascension
    Island" you should add the following lines to \verb+freshclam.conf+:
    \begin{verbatim}
	DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
	DatabaseMirror db.ac.clamav.net
	DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net
    \end{verbatim}
    The second entry acts as a fallback in case a connection to the first
    mirror fails for some reason. The full list of two-letters country codes
    is available at \url{http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm}

    \section{Usage}

    \subsection{Clam daemon}\label{clamd}
    \verb+clamd+ is a multi-threaded daemon that uses \emph{libclamav}
    to scan files against viruses. It may work in one of the two network modes,
    listening on a:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Unix (local) socket
	\item TCP socket
    \end{itemize}
    The daemon is fully configurable via the \verb+clamd.conf+ file
    \footnote{man 5 clamd.conf}. \verb+clamd+ recognizes the following commands:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{PING}\\
	    Check daemon state (should reply with "PONG").
	\item \textbf{VERSION}\\
	    Print program and database versions.
	\item \textbf{RELOAD}\\
	    Reload databases.
	\item \textbf{SHUTDOWN}\\
	    Perform a clean exit.
	\item \textbf{SCAN file/directory}
	    Scan file or directory (recursively) with archive support
	    enabled (a full path is required).
	\item \textbf{RAWSCAN file/directory}
	    Scan file or directory (recursively) with archive support
	    disabled (a full path is required).
	\item \textbf{CONTSCAN file/directory}
	    Scan file or directory (recursively) with archive support
	    enabled and do not stop scanning if virus is found.
	\item \textbf{STREAM}
	    Scan stream: \verb+clamd+ will return a new port number you should
	    connect to and send data to scan.
	\item \textbf{SESSION, END}
	    Start/end a \verb+clamd+ session - you can do multiple commands
	    per TCP session (WARNING: due to the \verb+clamd+ implementation the
	    \textbf{RELOAD} command will break the session).
    \end{itemize}
    and reacts to the special signals:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{SIGTERM} - perform a clean exit
	\item \textbf{SIGHUP} - reopen a log file
	\item \textbf{SIGUSR2} - reload the database
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Clam\textbf{d}scan}
    \verb+clamdscan+ is a simple \verb+clamd+ client. In many cases you can
    use it as a \verb+clamscan+ replacement but you must remember that:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item it only depends on \verb+clamd+
	\item although it accepts the same command line options as
	      \verb+clamscan+ most of them are ignored because they must be
	      enabled directly in \verb+clamd+, i.e. \verb+clamd.conf+
	\item scanned files must be accessible for \verb+clamd+
	\item it can't use external unpackers
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Clamuko}\label{clamuko}
    Clamuko is a special thread in \verb+clamd+ that performs on-access
    scanning under Linux and FreeBSD and shares internal virus database
    with the daemon. \textbf{You must follow some important rules when
    using it:}
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Always stop the daemon cleanly - using the SHUTDOWN command or
	      the\\ SIGTERM signal. In other case you can lose an access
	      to protected files until the system is restarted.
	\item Never protect a directory your mail-scanner software
	      uses for attachment unpacking. Access to all infected
	      files will be automatically blocked and the scanner (even
	      \verb+clamd+) won't be able to detect any virus. In the result
	      \textbf{all infected mails will be delivered.}
    \end{itemize}
    For example, to protect a whole system add the following lines to
    \verb+clamd.conf+:
    \begin{verbatim}
	ClamukoScanOnAccess
	ClamukoIncludePath /
	ClamukoExcludePath /proc
	ClamukoExcludePath /temporary/dir/of/your/mail/scanning/software
    \end{verbatim}
    You can also use clamuko to protect files on Samba/Netatalk but far
    more better and safe idea is to use the \textbf{samba-vscan} module
    \ref{samba-vscan}. NFS is not supported because Dazuko doesn't intercept
    NFS access calls.

    \subsection{Output format}

    \subsubsection{clamscan}
    \verb+clamscan+ by default writes all messages to \textbf{stderr}.
    Run it with \verb+--stdout+ enabled to redirect them to the standard
    output. An example of the \verb+clamscan+ output is:
    \begin{verbatim}
	/tmp/test/removal-tool.exe: Worm.Sober FOUND
	/tmp/test/md5.o: OK
	/tmp/test/blob.c: OK
	/tmp/test/message.c: OK
	/tmp/test/error.hta: VBS.Inor.D FOUND
    \end{verbatim}
    When a virus is found its name is printed between the \verb+filename:+ and
    \verb+FOUND+ strings. In case of archives the scanner depends on libclamav
    and only prints the first virus found within an archive:
    \begin{verbatim}
	zolw@localhost:/tmp$ clamscan malware.zip 
	malware.zip: Worm.Mydoom.U FOUND
    \end{verbatim}
    \emph{\textbf{TIP:} You can force clamscan to list all infected
    files in an archive using --no-archive (that disables transparent
    decompressors built into libclamav) and external decompressors: --unzip
    --unrar...}.\\[4pt]
    \begin{verbatim}
	zolw@localhost:/tmp$ clamscan --no-archive --unzip malware.zip
	Archive:  /tmp/malware.zip
	  inflating: test1.exe
	  inflating: test2.exe
	  inflating: test3.exe
	/tmp/clamav-77e7bfdbb2d3872b/test1.exe: Worm.Mydoom.U FOUND
	/tmp/clamav-77e7bfdbb2d3872b/test2.exe: Trojan.Taskkill.A FOUND
	/tmp/clamav-77e7bfdbb2d3872b/test3.exe: Worm.Nyxem.D FOUND
	/tmp/malware.zip: Infected.Archive FOUND
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{clamd}
    \verb+clamd+ uses a \verb+clamscan+ compatible output format:
    \begin{verbatim}
	zolw@localhost:~$ telnet localhost 3310
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	SCAN /home/zolw/test
	/home/zolw/test/clam.exe: ClamAV-Test-File FOUND
	Connection closed by foreign host.
    \end{verbatim}
    In the \textbf{SCAN} mode it closes the connection when the first virus
    is found.
    \begin{verbatim}
	SCAN /home/zolw/test/clam.zip
	/home/zolw/test/clam.zip: ClamAV-Test-File FOUND
    \end{verbatim}
    \textbf{CONTSCAN} continues scanning even if virus was already found.\\
    Error messages are printed in the following format:
    \begin{verbatim}
	SCAN /no/such/file
	/no/such/file: Can't stat() the file. ERROR
    \end{verbatim}

    \section{LibClamAV}
    libclamav is a simple and easy way to add a virus protection to your
    software. The library is thread-safe and transparently recognizes and
    scans within archives, mail files, MS Office document files, executables
    and other file formats.

    \subsection{Licence}
    libclamav is licensed under the GNU GPL licence. That means you are
    \textbf{not allowed} to link commercial, close-source applications
    against it\footnote{You can still use clamd or clamscan instead}.
    All software using libclamav must be GPL compliant.

    \subsection{Features}

    \subsubsection{Archives and compressed files}
    The library has a built-in support for the following formats:
    \begin{itemize}
	\item Zip
	\item RAR (2.0)
	\item Tar
	\item Gzip
	\item Bzip2
	\item MS OLE2
	\item MS Cabinet Files
	\item MS CHM (Compiled HTML)
	\item MS SZDD compression format
	\item UPX (all versions)
	\item FSG (1.3, 1.31, 1.33, 2.0)
	\item Petite (2.x)
    \end{itemize}
    Due to license issues, support for RAR 3.0 archives is currently not
    available in libclamav (such archives will trigger the
    \verb+RAR module failure.+ error message). You can scan them with the help
    of external unpackers in \verb+clamscan+, though.
    \begin{verbatim}
	$ clamscan --unrar clam-error.rar
	/home/zolw/test/clam-error.rar: RAR module failure.

	UNRAR 3.00 freeware      Copyright (c) 1993-2002 Eugene Roshal


	Extracting from /home/zolw/test/clam-error.rar

	Extracting  clam.exe                                        OK

	/home/zolw/test/clam-error.rar: Infected.Archive FOUND
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Mail files}
    Advanced mail scanner built into libclamav transparently scans e-mails
    for infected attachments. All popular UNIX mail formats are supported.
    TNEF attachments are supported as well.

    \subsection{API}

    \subsubsection{Header file}
    Every program using libclamav must include the \verb+clamav.h+ header
    file:
    \begin{verbatim}
	#include <clamav.h>
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Database loading}
    The following set of functions provides an interface to database
    initialisation mechanisms:
    \begin{verbatim}
	int cl_loaddb(const char *filename, struct cl_node **root,
	unsigned int *signo);

	int cl_loaddbdir(const char *dirname, struct cl_node **root,
	unsigned int *signo);

	const char *cl_retdbdir(void);
    \end{verbatim}
    \verb+cl_loaddb+ loads selected database while \verb+cl_loaddbdir+
    loads all databases from a \verb+dirname+ directory. \verb+cl_retdbdir+
    returns a default (hardcoded) database directory path. After an
    initialisation an internal database representation will be saved
    under \verb+root+ (which must initially point to NULL) and a number of
    loaded signatures will be \textbf{added} \footnote{Remember to initialize
    the virus counter variable with 0.} to \verb+virnum+. You can eventually
    pass NULL if you don't care about a signature counter. Both \verb+cl_loaddb+
    and \verb+cl_loaddbdir+ functions return 0 on success and a non-negative
    value on failure.
    \begin{verbatim}
	    ...
	    struct cl_node *root = NULL;
	    int ret, signo = 0;

	ret = cl_loaddbdir(cl_retdbdir(), &root, &signo);
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Error handling}
    Use \verb+cl_strerror+ to convert error codes into human readable messages.
    The function returns a statically allocated string:
    \begin{verbatim}
	if(ret) {
	    printf("cl_loaddbdir() error: %s\n", cl_strerror(ret));
	    exit(1);
	}
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Database structure}
    Now initialise internal transitions with \verb+cl_build+.
    \begin{verbatim}
	int cl_build(struct cl_node *root);
    \end{verbatim}
    In our example:
    \begin{verbatim}
	if((ret = cl_build(root)))
	    printf("cl_build() error: %s\n", cl_strerror(ret));
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsection{Database reloading}
    The most important thing is to keep the internal instance of the database
    up to date. You can watch database changes with the \verb+cl_stat+
    functions family.
    \begin{verbatim}
	int cl_statinidir(const char *dirname, struct cl_stat *dbstat);
	int cl_statchkdir(const struct cl_stat *dbstat);
	int cl_statfree(struct cl_stat *dbstat);
    \end{verbatim}
    Initialization:
    \begin{verbatim}
	    ...
	    struct cl_stat dbstat;

	memset(&dbstat, 0, sizeof(struct cl_stat));
	cl_statinidir(dbdir, &dbstat);
    \end{verbatim}
    To check for a change you only need to call \verb+cl_statchkdir+:
    \begin{verbatim}
	if(cl_statchkdir(&dbstat) == 1) {
	    reload_database...;
	    cl_statfree(&dbstat);
	    cl_statinidir(cl_retdbdir(), &dbstat);
	}
    \end{verbatim}
    Remember to reinitialize the structure after reload.

    \subsubsection{Data scan functions}
    It's possible to scan a buffer, a descriptor, or a file with:
    \begin{verbatim}
	int cl_scanbuff(const char *buffer, unsigned int length,
	const char **virname, const struct cl_node *root);

	int cl_scandesc(int desc, const char **virname, unsigned
	long int *scanned, const struct cl_node *root, const
	struct cl_limits *limits, unsigned int options);

	int cl_scanfile(const char *filename, const char **virname,
	unsigned long int *scanned, const struct cl_node *root,
	const struct cl_limits *limits, unsigned int options);
    \end{verbatim}
    All the functions save a virus name under \verb+virname+ pointer.
    It points to a field in the internal database structure and must not
    be released directly. If the \verb+scanned+ pointer is not NULL the
    functions will increase a value represented by this pointer by a size
    of scanned data in \verb+CL_COUNT_PRECISION+ units. The last two
    functions also support archive limits required to protect against Denial
    of Service attacks.
    \begin{verbatim}
	struct cl_limits {
	    int maxreclevel; /* maximal recursion level */
	    int maxfiles; /* maximal number of files to be
                   * scanned within archive
                   */
	    int maxratio; /* maximal compression ratio */
	    short archivememlim; /* limit memory usage for bzip2 (0/1) */
	    long int maxfilesize; /* archived files larger than this
                           * value will not be scanned
                           */
	};
    \end{verbatim}
    The \verb+options+ argument configures the scan engine and supports the
    following flags (that can be combined using bit operators):
    \begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_STDOPT}\\
	      This is an alias for a recommended set of scan options. You
	      should use it to make your software ready for new features
	      in future versions of libclamav.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_RAW}\\
	      It does nothing. Please use it (alone) if you don't want
	      to scan any special files.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_ARCHIVE}\\
	      This flag enables transparent scanning of various archive formats.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_BLOCKENCRYPTED}\\
	      With this flag the library marks encrypted archives as viruses
	      (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_BLOCKMAX}\\
	      Mark archives as viruses if \verb+maxfiles+, \verb+maxfilesize+,
	      or \verb+maxreclevel+ limit is reached.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_MAIL}\\
	      It enables support for mail files.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_MAILURL}\\
	      The mail scanner will download and scan URLs listed in a mail
	      body. This flag should not be used on loaded servers. Due to
	      potential problems please do not enable it by default but make
	      it optional.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_OLE2}\\
	      Enables support for Microsoft Office document files.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_PE}\\
	      This flag enables scanning withing Portable Executable files and
	      allows libclamav to unpack UPX, Petite, and FSG compressed
	      executables.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_BLOCKBROKEN}\\
	      libclamav will try to detect broken executables and mark them as
	      Broken.Executable.
	\item \textbf{CL\_SCAN\_HTML}\\
	      This flag enables HTML normalisation (including JScript
	      decryption).
    \end{itemize}
    All functions return 0 (\verb+CL_CLEAN+) if the file is clean,
    \verb+CL_VIRUS+ when virus is detected and an another value on failure.
    \begin{verbatim}
	    ...
	    struct cl_limits limits;
	    const char *virname;

	memset(&limits, 0, sizeof(struct cl_limits));
	/* maximal number of files in archive */;
	limits.maxfiles = 1000
	/* maximal archived file size */
	limits.maxfilesize = 10 * 1048576; /* 10 MB */
	/* maximal recursion level */
	limits.maxreclevel = 5;
	/* maximal compression ratio */
	limits.maxratio = 200;
	/* disable memory limit for bzip2 scanner */
	limits.archivememlim = 0;

	if((ret = cl_scanfile("/home/zolw/test", &virname, NULL, root,
	&limits, CL_STDOPT)) == CL_VIRUS) {
	    printf("Detected %s virus.\n", virname);
	} else {
	    printf("No virus detected.\n");
	    if(ret != CL_CLEAN)
	        printf("Error: %s\n", cl_strerror(ret));
	}
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Memory}
    Because the internal database uses a few megabytes of memory, you should
    release it if you no longer need to scan files.
    \begin{verbatim}
	void cl_free(struct cl_node *root);
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{clamav-config}
    Use \verb+clamav-config+ to check libclamav compilation information.
    \begin{verbatim}
	zolw@localhost:~$ clamav-config --libs
	-L/usr/local/lib -lz -lbz2 -lgmp -lpthread
	zolw@localhost:~$ clamav-config --cflags
	-I/usr/local/include -g -O2
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsubsection{Example}
    You will find an example scanner application in the clamav sources
    (/example). Remember that all programs based on libclamav must be linked
    against it:
    \begin{verbatim}
	gcc -Wall ex1.c -o ex1 -lclamav
    \end{verbatim}

    \subsection{CVD format}
    CVD (ClamAV Virus Database) is a digitally signed tarball file that
    contains one or more databases. The header is a 512 bytes long string
    with colon separated fields:
    \begin{verbatim}
ClamAV-VDB:build time:version:number of signatures:functionality
level required:MD5 checksum:digital signature:builder name:build time (sec)
    \end{verbatim}
    \verb+sigtool --info+ displays detailed information on CVD files:
    \begin{verbatim}
    zolw@localhost:/usr/local/share/clamav$ sigtool -i daily.cvd 
    Build time: 11 Sep 2004 21-07 +0200
    Version: 487
    # of signatures: 1189
    Functionality level: 2
    Builder: ccordes
    MD5: a3f4f98694229e461f17d2aa254e9a43
    Digital signature: uwJS6d+y/9g5SXGE0Hh1rXyjZW/PGK/zqVtWWVL3/tfHEn

    UjUOXo1VwQlW7l86HZmiMUSyAjnF/gciOSsOQa9Hli8D5uET1RDzVpoWu/id
    Verification OK.
    \end{verbatim}

    \section{Frequently Asked Questions}
    The FAQ section is maintained by Luca Gibelli.

    \begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{What does \emph{WARNING: Current functionality level = 1,
	required = 2} mean?}\\
	The functionality level of the database determines which scanner engine
	version is required to use all of its signatures. If you don't upgrade
	immediately you will be in big trouble.

	\item \textbf{What does \emph{Your ClamAV installation is OUTDATED}
	mean?}\\
	You'll get this message whenever a new version of ClamAV is released.
	In order to detect all the latest viruses, it's not enough to keep your
	database up to date. You also need to run the latest version of the
	scanner. You can find the latest release at \url{http://www.clamav.net}
	under the \verb+stable+ link. Running the latest stable release also
	improves stability.

	\item \textbf{What does \emph{WARNING: DNS record is older than 3 hours}
	mean?}\\
	freshclam attempts to detect potential problems with DNS caches and
	switches to the old mode if something looks suspicious. If this message
	appears seldomly, you can safely ignore it. If you get the error
	everytime you run freshclam, you should check your dns settings.

	\item \textbf{What does \emph{SECURITY WARNING: NO SUPPORT FOR DIGITAL
	SIGNATURES} mean?}\\
	The ClamAV package requires the GMP library to verify the digital
	signature of the virus database. When building ClamAV you need the
	GMP library and its headers: if you are using Debian just run
	\verb+apt-get install libgmp3-dev+, if you are using an RPM based
	distribution install the gmp-devel package.

	\item \textbf{How often is the virus database updated?}\\
	The virus database is usually updated many times per week. Check out
	\url{http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.virus.clamav.virusdb/}
	to see our response times to new threats. The virusdb team tries to
	keep up with the latest worm in the wild. When a new worm spreads out,
	often it is less than one hour before we release a database update.
	You can contribute to make the virusdb updating process more efficient
	by submitting samples of viruses via our web interface.

	\item \textbf{I tried to submit a sample through the web interface,
	but it said the sample is already recognized by ClamAV. My clamscan
	tells me it's not. I already updated my database, what's wrong with
	my setup?}\\
	Please run clamscan with the --mbox option. Also check that freshclam
	and clamscan are using the same path for storing/reading the database.

	\item \textbf{ClamAV crashes/hangs/doesn't compile/doesn't start. Did
	I find a bug?}\\
	Before reporting a bug, please download the latest CVS code and try to
	reproduce the bug with it. Chances are the bug you encountered has
	already been fixed. If you really feel like you found a bug, please
	send a message \email{bugs*clamav.net}.

	\item \textbf{How do I automatically restart clamd when it dies?}\\
	Set up a cronjob which checks that clamd is up and running, every XX
	minutes. You can find an example script in the
	\verb+contrib/clamdwatch/+ directory.

	\item \textbf{How do I keep my virus database up to date?}\\
	ClamAV comes with freshclam, a tool which periodically checks for
	new database releases and keeps your database up to date.

	\item \textbf{I'm running ClamAV on a lot of clients on my local
	network. Can I mirror the database locally so that each client
	doesn't have to download it from your servers?}\\
	Sure, install a proxy server and then configure your freshclam clients
	to use it (watch for the \verb+HTTPProxyServer+ parameter in
	\verb+man freshclam.conf+). Alternatively, you can configure a local
	webserver on one of your machines (say machine1.mylan) and let
	freshclam download the *.cvd files from
	\url{http://database.clamav.net/} to the webserver's
	\verb+DocumentRoot+. Finally, change \verb+freshclam.conf+ on your
	clients so that it reads: \verb+DatabaseMirror machine1.mylan+
	First the database will be downloaded to the local webserver and then
	the other clients on the network will update their copy of the database
	from it.

	\item \textbf{How can I list the virus signature names contained in
	the database?}\\
	If you are using a recent version of ClamAV just run:
	\verb+$sigtool --list-sigs+

	\item \textbf{I found an infected file in my HD/floppy/mailbox, but
	ClamAV doesn't recognize it yet. Can you help me?}\\
	Our virus database is kept up to date with the help of the community.
	Whenever you find a new virus which is not detected by ClamAV you
	should submit it on our website (go to \url{www.clamav.net} and
	click on \emph{submit sample}). The virusdb team will review your
	submission and update the database if necessary. Before submitting
	a new sample:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item check that the value of \verb+DatabaseDirectory+, in both
	    \verb+clamd.conf+ and\\ \verb+freshclam.conf+, is the same
	    \item update your database by running freshclam
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Why is ClamAV calling the XXX virus with another name?}\\
	This usually happens when we add a signature before other AV
	vendors. No well-known name is available at that moment so we have to
	invent one. Renaming the virus after a few days would just confuse
	people more, so we usually keep on using our name for that virus. The
	only exception is when a new name is established soon after the
	signature addition. You can find more info about this in the virus
	naming page at \url{http://www.clamav.net/cvdinfo.html}

	\item \textbf{How do I know when database updates are released?}\\
	Subscribe to the \emph{clamav-virusdb} mailing-list.

	\item \textbf{How can I scan a file on my hard disk for viruses
	without installing ClamAV?}\\
	Use the online scanning tool available at
	\url{http://test-clamav.power-netz.de/}

	\item \textbf{I found a false positive in ClamAV virus database. What
	shall I do?}\\
	Fill the form at \url{http://www.clamav.net/sendvirus.html} Be sure to
	select \emph{The file attached is... a false positive}

	\item \textbf{How do I verify the integrity of ClamAV sources?}\\
	Using GnuPG (\url{http://www.gnupg.org/}) you can easily verify the
	authenticity of your stable release downloads by using the following
	method:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Download Tomasz Kojm's key from the clamav.net site:\\
	\verb+$ wget http://www.clamav.net/gpg/tkojm.gpg+
	\item Import the key into your local public keyring:\\
	\verb+\$ gpg --import tkojm.gpg+
	\item Download the stable release AND the corresponding .sig file to

	\item Verify that the stable release download is signed with the proper
	key:\\
	\verb+$ gpg --verify clamav-X.XX.tar.gz.sig+
	\item Make sure the resulting output contain the following
	information:\\
	\verb+Good signature from Tomasz Kojm (tk*lodz.tpnet.pl)+
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Can ClamAV disinfect files?}\\
	No, it can't. We will add support for disinfecting OLE2 files in one
	of the next stable releases. There are no plans for disinfecting other
	types of files. There are many reasons for it: cleaning viruses from
	files is virtually pointless these days. It is very seldom that there
	is anything useful left after cleaning, and even if there is,
	would you trust it?

	\item \textbf{When using clamscan, is there a way to know which message
	within an mbox is infected?}\\
	No, clamscan stops at the first infected message. You can convert the
	mbox to Maildir format, run clamscan on it and then convert it back to
	mbox format. There are many tools available which can convert to and
	from Maildir format, e.g: formail, mbox2maildir, and maildir2mbox.

	\item \textbf{I'm running qmail+Qmail-Scanner+ClamAV and get the
	following error in my mail logs: \emph{clamdscan: corrupt or unknown
	clamd scanner error or memory/resource/perms problem}. What's wrong
	with it?}\\
	Most likely clamd is not running at all, or you are running
	Qmail-Scanner and clamd under a different uid. If you are running
	Qmail-Scanner as qscand (default setting) you could put
	\verb+User qscand+ inside your clamd.conf file and restart clamd.
	Remember to check that qscand can create clamd.ctl (usually located at
	\verb+/var/run/clamav/clamd.ctl+). The same applies to the log file.

	\item \textbf{How do I use ClamAV with p3scan?}\\
	Add the following lines to your pop3vscan configuration file:
	\begin{verbatim}
	    virusregexp = .*: (.*) FOUND
	    scanner = /usr/bin/clamdscan --no-summary -i
	    scannertype = basic
	\end{verbatim}

	\item \textbf{Where can I ask questions about using ClamAV?}\\
	Subscribe to our \emph{clamav-users} mailing-list at
	\url{http://www.clamav.net/ml.html}

	\item \textbf{Where can I get the latest CVS snapshot of ClamAV?}\\
	Basically, there are two ways:
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item Run\\
	    \verb+cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/clamav co clamav-devel+
	    \item Visit \url{http://www.clamav.net/snapshot/}
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{I'm a MS Windows user. Can I take advantage of ClamAV
	virus protection?}\\
	Yes, you can use ClamWin, a port of ClamAV for win32 systems with a
	very nice graphic interface. Download it at \url{http://www.clamwin.net}

	\item \textbf{Where can I find more information about ClamAV?}\\
	Please read this documentation. You can also try searching the mailing
	list archives. If you can't find the answer, you can ask for support on
	the clamav-users mailing-list, but please before doing it, search the
	archives! Also, make sure that you don't send HTML-ized email messages
	and that you don't top-post (these violate the netiquette and lessen
	your chances of being answered).

	\item \textbf{How can I contribute to the ClamAV project?}\\
	There are many ways to contribute to the ClamAV project. See the
	donations page (\url{http://www.clamav.net/donate.html} for more info.
