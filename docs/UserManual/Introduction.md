# Introduction

Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPLv2) anti-virus toolkit, designed especially for e-mail scanning on mail gateways.  It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates.  The core of the package is an anti-virus engine available in a form of shared library.

## Features

### Capabilities

- ClamAV is designed to scan files quickly.
- Real time protection (Linux only).  Our scanning daemon supports on-access scanning on modern versions of Linux, including the ability to block file access until a file has been scanned.
- ClamAV detects over 1 million viruses, worms and trojans, including Microsoft Office macro viruses, mobile malware, and other threats.
- The built-in bytecode interpreter allows the ClamAV signature writers to create and distribute very complex detection routines and remotely enhance the scannerâ€™s functionality.
