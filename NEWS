0.98.5
------

Welcome to ClamAV 0.98.5! ClamAV 0.98.5 includes important new features
for collecting and analyzing file properties. Software developers and
analysts may collect file property meta data using the ClamAV API for
subsequent analysis by ClamAV bytecode programs. Using these features
will require that libjson-c is installed, but otherwise libjson-c is not
needed.

Look for our upcoming series of blog posts to learn more about using the
ClamAV API and bytecode facilities for collecting and analyzing file
properties.

ClamAV 0.98.5 also includes these new features and bug fixes:

    - Support for the XDP file format and extracting, decoding, and
      scanning PDF files within XDP files.
    - Addition of shared library support for LLVM versions 3.1 - 3.5
      for the purpose of just-in-time(JIT) compilation of ClamAV
      bytecode signatures. Andreas Cadhalpun submitted the patch
      implementing this support.
    - Enhancements to the clambc command line utility to assist
      ClamAV bytecode signature authors by providing introspection
      into compiled bytecode programs.
    - Resolution of many of the warning messages from ClamAV compilation.
    - Improved detection of malicious PE files.
    - Security fix for ClamAV crash when using 'clamscan -a'. This issue
      was identified by Kurt Siefried of Red Hat.
    - Security fix for ClamAV crash when scanning maliciously crafted
      yoda's crypter files. This issue, as well as several other bugs
      fixed in this release, were identified by Damien Millescamp of
      Oppida.
    - ClamAV 0.98.5 now works with OpenSSL in FIPS compliant mode.
      Thanks to Reinhard Max for supplying the patch.
    - Bug fixes and other feature enhancements. See Changelog or
      git log for details.
