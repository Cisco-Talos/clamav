0.98.5
------

Welcome to ClamAV 0.98.5! ClamAV 0.98.5 includes important new features
for collecting and analyzing file properties. Software developers and
analysts may collect file properties using the ClamAV API and then
analyze them with ClamAV bytecode programs. Using the new features will
require that libjson-c is installed, but otherwise libjson-c will be
optional.

Look for our upcoming series of blog posts to learn more about using the
ClamAV API and bytecode facilities for collecting and analyzing file
properties.
