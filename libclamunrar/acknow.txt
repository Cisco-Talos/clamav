                           ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

* We used "Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel
  SIMD Instructions" paper by James S. Plank, Kevin M. Greenan
  and Ethan L. Miller to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.
  Also we are grateful to Artem Drobanov and Bulat Ziganshin
  for samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding
  more efficient.

* RAR text compression algorithm is based on Dmitry Shkarin PPMII
  and Dmitry Subbotin carryless rangecoder public domain source code.
  You may find it in ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack.

* RAR encryption includes parts of code from Szymon Stefanek
  and Brian Gladman AES implementations also as Steve Reid SHA-1 source.
