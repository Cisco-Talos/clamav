                           ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

* We used "Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel
  SIMD Instructions" paper by James S. Plank, Kevin M. Greenan
  and Ethan L. Miller to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.
  Also we are grateful to Artem Drobanov and Bulat Ziganshin
  for samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding
  more efficient.

* RAR4 text compression algorithm is based on Dmitry Shkarin PPMII
  and Dmitry Subbotin carryless rangecoder public domain source code.
  You can find it in ftp.elf.stuba.sk/pub/pc/pack.

* RAR encryption includes parts of public domain code
  from Szymon Stefanek AES and Steve Reid SHA-1 implementations.

* With exception of SFX modules, RAR uses CRC32 function based
  on Intel Slicing-by-8 algorithm. Original Intel Slicing-by-8 code
  is available here:

    https://sourceforge.net/projects/slicing-by-8/

* RAR archives may optionally include BLAKE2sp hash ( https://blake2.net ),
  designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn
  and Christian Winnerlein.

* Useful hints provided by Alexander Khoroshev and Bulat Ziganshin allowed
  to significantly improve RAR compression and speed.
