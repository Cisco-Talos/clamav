# Comment or remove the line below.
Example

# Uncomment this option to enable logging.
# LogFile must be writable for the user running daemon.
# A full path is required.
# Default: disabled
#LogFile /tmp/clamd.log

# By default the log file is locked for writing - the lock protects against
# running clamd multiple times (if want to run another clamd, please
# copy the configuration file, change the LogFile variable, and run
# the daemon with --config-file option).
# This option disables log file locking.
# Default: no
#LogFileUnlock yes

# Maximal size of the log file.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# You may use 'M' or 'm' for megabytes (1M = 1m = 1048576 bytes)
# and 'K' or 'k' for kilobytes (1K = 1k = 1024 bytes). To specify the size
# in bytes just don't use modifiers.
# Default: 1M
#LogFileMaxSize 2M

# Log time with each message.
# Default: no
#LogTime yes

# Also log clean files. Useful in debugging but drastically increases the
# log size.
# Default: no
#LogClean yes

# Use system logger (can work together with LogFile).
# Default: no
#LogSyslog yes

# Specify the type of syslog messages - please refer to 'man syslog'
# for facility names.

# Default: no
#LogVerbose yes

# This option allows you to save a process identifier of the listening
# daemon (main thread).
# Default: disabled
#PidFile /var/run/clamd.pid

# Optional path to the global temporary directory.
# Default: system specific (usually /tmp or /var/tmp).
#TemporaryDirectory /var/tmp

# Path to the database directory.
# Default: hardcoded (depends on installation options)
#DatabaseDirectory /var/lib/clamav

# The daemon works in a local OR a network mode. Due to security reasons we
# recommend the local mode.

# Path to a local socket file the daemon will listen on.
# Default: disabled (must be specified by a user)
LocalSocket /tmp/clamd

# Remove stale socket after unclean shutdown.
# Default: no
#FixStaleSocket yes

# TCP port address.
# Default: no
#TCPSocket 3310

# TCP address.
# By default we bind to INADDR_ANY, probably not wise.
# Enable the following to provide some degree of protection
# from the outside world.
# Default: no
#TCPAddr 127.0.0.1

# Maximum length the queue of pending connections may grow to.
# Default: 15
#MaxConnectionQueueLength 30

# Clamd uses FTP-like protocol to receive data from remote clients.
# If you are using clamav-milter to balance load between remote clamd daemons
# on firewall servers you may need to tune the options below.

# Close the connection when the data size limit is exceeded.
# The value should match your MTA's limit for a maximal attachment size.
# Default: 10M
#StreamMaxLength 20M

# Limit port range.
# Default: 1024
#StreamMinPort 30000
# Default: 2048

# Waiting for a new job will timeout after this time (seconds).
# Default: 30
#IdleTimeout 60

# Maximal depth directories are scanned at.
# Default: 15
#MaxDirectoryRecursion 20

# Follow directory symlinks.
# Default: no
#FollowDirectorySymlinks yes

# Follow regular file symlinks.
# Default: no
#FollowFileSymlinks yes

# Perform internal sanity check (database integrity and freshness).
# Default: 1800 (30 min)
#SelfCheck 600

# Execute a command when virus is found. In the command string %v will
# be replaced by a virus name.
# Default: no
#VirusEvent /usr/local/bin/send_sms 123456789 "VIRUS ALERT: %v"

# Default: no
#Debug yes

# Do not remove temporary files (for debug purposes).

# In some cases (eg. complex malware, exploits in graphic files, and others),
# ClamAV uses special algorithms to provide accurate detection. This option
# controls the algorithmic detection.
# Default: yes
#AlgorithmicDetection yes

##
## Executable files
##

# PE stands for Portable Executable - it's an executable file format used
# in all 32-bit versions of Windows operating systems. This option allows
# ClamAV to perform a deeper analysis of executable files and it's also
# required for decompression of popular executable packers such as UPX, FSG,
# and Petite.
# Default: yes
#ScanPE yes

# With this option clamav will try to detect broken executables and mark
# them as Broken.Executable
# Default: no
#DetectBrokenExecutables yes

#ScanMail yes

# If an email contains URLs ClamAV can download and scan them.
# WARNING: This option may open your system to a DoS attack.
#	   Never use it on loaded servers.
# Default: no

# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 10M

# Default: 8
#ArchiveMaxRecursion 10

# Number of files to be scanned within an archive.
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 1000

# times it will be marked as a virus (Oversized.ArchiveType, e.g. Oversized.Zip)
# Value of 0 disables the limit.
# Default: 250
#ArchiveMaxCompressionRatio 300

# Use slower but memory efficient decompression algorithm.
# only affects the bzip2 decompressor.
# Default: no
#ArchiveLimitMemoryUsage yes

# Mark encrypted archives as viruses (Encrypted.Zip, Encrypted.RAR).

# if ArchiveMaxFiles, ArchiveMaxFileSize, or ArchiveMaxRecursion limit is
# reached.
# Default: no
#ArchiveBlockMax no

# Enable support for Sensory Networks' NodalCore hardware accelerator.
# Default: no
#HardwareAcceleration yes
