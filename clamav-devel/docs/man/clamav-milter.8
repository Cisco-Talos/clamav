.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP
clamav\-milter [options] socket_address
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
clamav\-milter is a filter for sendmail mail server. It uses a mail scanning engine built into clamd.
.LP
clamav\-milter requires \fBclamd(8)\fR to run.
When starting, clamav\-milter verifies that it can communicate with clamd;
if it cannot it terminates.
.LP
clamav\-milter supports tcpwrappers, the value for \fIdaemon_list\fR
is "clamav\-milter".
.LP
The socket_address argument is the socket used to communicate with
\fBsendmail(8)\fR.
It must agree with the entry in sendmail.cf or sendmail.mc.
The file associated with the socket must be createable by clamav\-milter,
if the User option is set in
\fBclamd.conf(5)\fR,
then that user must have the rights to create the file.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP

.TP
\fB-a FROM, \-\-from<=EMAIL>\fR
Source email address of notices. The default is MAILER-DAEMON.
If \fI=EMAIL\fR is not given, thus \-\-from, then the from address is set
to the originating email address, however since it is likely that address is
forged it must not be relied upon.
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Output the help information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-H, \-\-headers\fR
Include all headers in the content of emails generated by clamav\-milter.
This is useful for system administrators who may want to look at headers
to check if any of their machines are infected.
.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-c FILE, \-\-config\-file=FILE\fR
By default clamav\-milter uses a default configuration file, this option allows you to specify another one.
.TP
\fB\D, \-\-debug\fR
Enables debugging.
.TP
\fB\-x n, \-\-debug\-level=n\fR
Set the debug level to n (where n from [0..9]) if \fBclamav\-milter\fR was
configured and compiled with \-\-clamav-debug enabled.
Will be replaced by \-\-debug for compatability with other programs in the
suite.
.TP
\fB-A, \-\-advisory\fR
When in advisory mode, clamav\-milter flags emails with viruses but
still forwards them. The default option is to stop viruses.
This mode is in compatible with \-\-quarantine and \-\-quarantine-dir.
.TP
\fB\-b, \-\-bounce\fR
Send a failure message to the sender, and to the postmaster.
[ \fBWarning\fR: most viruses and worms
fake their source address, so this option is not recommended ].
See also \-\-noreject.
.TP
\fB\-B, \-\-broadcast[=<iface>]\fR
When a virus is intercepted, broadcast a UDP message to the TCPSocket port set
in \fBclamd.conf\fR.
If the optional \fIiface\fR option is given, broadcasts will be sent on
that interface. The default is set by the opertating system, usually to the
first NIC.
A future network management program (yet to be written) will intercept these
broadcasts to raise a warning on the operator's desk.
.TP
\fB-C, \-\-dont-log-clean\fR
Messages without viruses are usually logged if SysLog is set in
\fBclamd.conf\fR since it gives a feel-good factor.
This option turns that off.
.TP
\fB-d, \-\-dont-scan-on-error\fR
If a system error occurs pass messages through unscanned,
usually when a system error occurs the milter raises a temporary failure which
generally causes the message to remain in the queue.
.TP
\fB-f, \-\-force-scan\fR
Always scan, whereever the message came from (see also --local and --outgoing).
You probably don't want this.
.TP
\fB-l, \-\-local\fR
Also scan messages sent from LAN. You probably want this especially if
your LAN is populated by machines running Windows or DOS.
.TP
\fB-n, \-\-noxheader\fR
Usually clamav\-milter adds headings to messages that are scanned.
The headers are of the form "X-Virus-Scanned: version",
and "X-Virus-Status: clean/infected/not-scanned".
This option instructs
clamav\-milter to refrain from adding this heading.
.TP
\fB-N, \-\-noreject\fR
When clamav\-milter processes an e-mail which contains a virus it rejects
the e-mail by using the SMTP code 550 or 554 depending on the state machine.
This option causes clamav\-milter to silently discard such messages.
It is recommended that system administrators use this option when NOT using
the \-\-bounce option.
.TP
\fB-o, \-\-outgoing\fR
Scan messages generated from this machine. You probably don't need this.
.TP
\fB-i, \-\-pidfile=FILE\fR
Notifies clamav\-milter to store its process ID in FILE.
The file must be createable by clamav\-milter,
if the User option is set in
\fBclamd.conf(5)\fR,
then that user must have the rights to create the file.
.TP
\fB-p, \-\-postmaster=EMAILADDRESS\fR
Sets the e-mail address to send notifications to when the \-\-quiet option
is not given.
.TP
\fB-P, \-\-postmaster-only\fR
When the \-\-quiet option is not given, send a notification to the postmaster.
Setting this flag will include the ID of the message which can ease searching
through system logs if the administrator believes it is a locally sourced
virus.
.TP
\fB-q, \-\-quiet\fR
Don't send any warning messages when a virus or worm or is detected.
This option overrides the \-\-bounce and \-\-postmaster-only options, and is
the way to turn off notification to the postmaster.
.TP
\fB-Q, \-\-quarantine=EMAILADDRESS\fR
If this e-mail address is given, messages containing a virus or worm are
redirected to it.
.TP
\fB-U, \-\-quarantine-dir=DIR\fR
If this option is given, infected files are left in this directory.
The directory must not be publically readable or writeable, if it is,
clamav\-milter will issue an error and fail to start.
\fBNote\fR - this option only works when using LocalSocket.
.TP
\fB\-\-server=HOSTNAME/ADDRESS, \-s HOSTNAME/ADDRESS\fR
IP address or hostname of server(s) running clamd (when using TCPsocket).
More than one server may be specified, separating the server's names by colons.
If more than one server is specified, clamav\-milter will load balance
between the available servers. All the servers must be up when clamav\-milter
starts, however afterwards it is fault tolerant to a server becoming
unavailable, and will only raise an error if all of the servers cannot be
reached.
The default value for ADDRESS is 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
.TP
\fB\-\-sign, \-S\fR
Add a hard\-coded signature to each scanned file.
.TP
\fB\-\-signature-file, \-F\fR
Location of file to be appended to each scanned message. Overrides \-S.
.TP
\fB\-\-max\-children=n, \-m n\fR
Set a hint of the maximum number of children. If the number is hit the
maximum time a pending thread will be held up is set by \-\-timeout, so the
number of threads can exceed this number for short periods of time.
There is no default, if this argument is not \fBclamav\-milter\fR will
spawn as many children as is necessary up to the MaxThreads limit set
in \fBclamd.conf\fR.
Most users will not need this option, if in doubt do not set it.
.TP
\fB\-\-dont\-wait\fR
Tells clamav\-milter what do to if the max-children number is exceeded.
Usuaully clamav\-milter waits until a child dies or the timeout value has been
exceeded, which ever comes first, however with dont-wait enabled, clamav\-milter
will inform the remote SMTP client to retry later.
.TP
\fB\-\-template\-file=file \-t file\fR
File points to a file whose contents is sent as the warning message whenever a
virus is intercepted.
Occurances of %v within the file is replaced with the message
returned from clamd, which includes the name of the virus.
Occurances of %h are replaced with the message's headers.
The %v string can be escaped thus, \\%v, to send the string %v.
The % character can be escaped thus, %%, to send the % character.
Any occurance of strings in dollar signs are replaced with the appropriate
sendmail-variable, e.g. ${if_addr}$.
If the \-t option is not given, clamav\-milter defaults to a hardcoded message.
.TP
\fB\-\-timeout=n \-T n\fR
Used in conjuction with max\-children. If clamav\-milter waits for more than
\fIn\fR seconds (default 60) it proceeds with scanning. Setting \fIn\fR to zero
will turn off the timeout and clamav\-milter will wait indefinately for the
scanning to quit. In practice the timeout set by sendmail will then take over.
.SH "BUGS"
There is no support for IPv6.
