The ClamAV team (http://www.clamav.net/team.html)


0.80rc4
-------

Improvements in this release include better JPEG exploit verification,
faster base64 decoding, support for GNU tar files, updated on-access scanner,
and others.

The ClamAV team (http://www.clamav.net/team.html)

0.80rc3
-------

This release candidate eliminates possible false positive alerts in UPX/FSG
compressed files and clarifies behaviour of default actions in clamd and
freshclam.

We encourage users to take advantage of our new mirror structure. In order to
download the database from the closest mirror you should configure freshclam
to use db.XY.clamav.net where XY is your country code (see
http://www.iana.org/cctld/cctld-whois.htm for the full list). Please add
the following lines to freshclam.conf:

    DNSDatabaseInfo current.cvd.clamav.net
    DatabaseMirror db.XY.clamav.net
    DatabaseMirror database.clamav.net

DNSDatabaseInfo enables database and software version verification through
DNS TXT records, and the second database mirror acts as a fallback in case
a connection to the first mirror fails for some reason.


0.80rc2
-------

This update fixes a serious bug in e-mail scanner.


0.80rc
------

The development version of ClamAV is ready for general testing! New mechanisms
have already proved very nasty to Internet worms successfully protecting
against the new versions R, S, T, U, V and W of the infamous Mydoom worm
and detecting them as Worm.Mydoom.Gen before they were analysed and specific
signatures added by the ClamAV database maintainers. That means servers running
the new version of ClamAV have detected and blocked 100% of Mydoom attacks!

New features in this release include:

-) libclamav
    + Portable Executable analyser (CL_SCAN_PE) featuring:
	o UPX decompression (all versions)
	o Petite decompression (2.x)
	o FSG decompression (1.3, 1.31, 1.33)
	o detection of broken executables (CL_SCAN_BLOCKBROKEN)
    + new, memory efficient, pattern matching algorithm (multipattern variant
      of Boyer-Moore) - it's now primary matcher and Aho-Corasick is only used
      for regular expression extended signatures
    + new signature format with advanced target type and offset specification
    + support for MD5 based signatures
    + extended regular expression scanner
    + added support for MS cabinet files

    + new method of mail files detection
    + all e-mail attachments are now scanned (previously only the first ten
      attachments were scanned)
    + added support for scanning URLs in e-mails (CL_SCAN_MAILURL)
    + detection of Worm.Mydoom.M.log
    + updated API (still backward compatible but please consult clamdoc.pdf
      (Section 6) and adapt your software)

-) clamd
    + new directive ScanHTML (enables HTML normalisator and ScrEnc decoder)
    + new directive ScanPE (win32 executable analyser and decompressor)
    + new directive DetectBrokenExecutables (try to detect broken executables
      and mark them as Broken.Executable)
    + new directive MailFollowURLs (try to download and scan files from URLs
      in mails. BE CAREFUL! DO NOT ENABLE IT ON LOADED MAIL SERVERS)
    + new directive ArchiveBlockMax (archives that exceed limits will be
      marked as viruses)
    + clamav.conf was renamed clamd.conf

-) clamscan
    + mail files are scanned by default, use --no-mail to disable it
    + new option --no-html (disables HTML normalisator)
    + new option --no-pe (disables PE analyser)
    + new option --detect-broken
    + new option --block-max
    + new option --mail-follow-urls (download and scan files from URLs in mails)

-) clamdscan
    + now prints warnings if some activated command line options are only
      supported by clamscan
    + added support for archive scanning in stdin mode

-) clamav-milter
    + improved template file format
    + quarantined file names now contain virus names
    + initial support for SESSION mode of clamd

-) freshclam:
    + new directive DNSDatabaseInfo that enables ultra lightweight version
      verification method through DNS (using TXT records). Based on idea by
      Christopher X. Candreva and enabled by default.
      (see http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/clamav/users/11102)
    + new option --no-dns (quick option to disable DNS method without editing
      freshclam.conf)

-) sigtool
    + removed ability of automatic signature generation (use MD5 sums to
      create your own signatures, see signatures.pdf for details)
    + new option --md5
    + new option --html-normalise (saves HTML normalisation and decryption
      results in three html files in current directory)

    + official documentation rewritten and outdated docs removed

-) new 3rd party software with support for ClamAV:
    + OdeiaVir - an e-mail filter for qmail and Exim
    + ClamSMTP - a lightweight (written in C) and simple filter for Postfix
    + Protea AntiVirus Tools - a virus filter for Lotus Domino
    + PTSMail Utilities - an e-mail filter for Sendmail
    + mxGuard for IMail - a mail filter for Ipswitch IMail (W32)

Special thanks to aCaB for his work on UPX, FSG and Petite decompressors.

Thanks to good reaction times on new threats ClamAV was awarded as best
security tool for 2004 by Linux Journal: "...With this year's outbreak of
e-mail worms for non-Linux platforms, ClamAV has been getting quite a workout,
and Linux admins on mailing lists report that database update times are keeping
up with or beating the proprietary alternatives." Thanks!

SourceWear.com is selling some very nice t-shirts and polo shirts powered by
ClamAV. Wear them and virus writers will stay away from you :-) A quarter out
of every dollar profited from the sale of these shirts will go to the ClamAV
project. Visit http://www.sourcewear.com and click on ClamAV logo!

0.75
----

This release fixes detection of e-mails generated by Worm.Mydoom.I.

Important notice for people using ClamAV 0.60:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our logs show that there is still a small percentage of ClamAV 0.60
installations updating their database. ClamAV 0.60 was released on
July 29th, 2003 and it was the last release to use the old database
format. Starting from version 0.65, released on November 12nd, ClamAV
uses a new database format, which is compressed and digitally signed.
We have been distributing the database in both formats till now, but
we plan to drop support for ClamAV 0.60 on September 1st.

We encourage _all_ users to upgrade to the latest release available.
People running an old version of ClamAV are missing many viruses and 
may experience stability problems.

On non-production systems you can try the latest development version.
The new engine not only speeds up the scanning process but also limits
memory usage by about 8 MB ! It's able to scan new formats, including
CAB, CHM, UPX, HTML (normalisation), PowerPoint macros and can detect
annoying e-mails with empty attachments generated by new Bagle variants.

Thanks to the help of many companies (clamdoc.pdf: Section 2.10,
http://www.clamav.net/mirrors.html) we have 49 very fast and reliable
virus database mirrors in 22 regions and the number is still growing.
As of March 2004 we attempt to redirect our users to the closest pool
of mirrors by looking at their ip source address when they try to resolve
database.clamav.net. Our DNS servers can answer with a CNAME to:
db.europe.clamav.net, db.america.clamav.net, db.asia.clamav.net or
db.other.clamav.net. Our advanced push-mirroring mechanism (maintained by
Luca Gibelli) allows database maintainers to update all the mirrors in less
than one minute !


There will be no major feature enhancements in the 0.7x series. Our work
will be concentrated on a new scanning engine and preliminary heuristics -
please help us and test CVS snapshots from time to time.


We are happy to announce new programs with support for ClamAV (all of them
have been reviewed by our team - more info in the documentation and
on our website: http://www.clamav.net/3rdparty.html):

News:

ClamAV was the first anti-virus protecting against Worm.SCO.A (aka MyDoom.A) !
The signature was published by Diego d'Ambra in the daily update 105,
26-Jan-2004 20:23 GMT and we were at least two hours faster than "big" AV
vendors:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=3764826&forum_id=34654
http://www.pcwelt.de/news/viren_bugs/37278/4.html


clamav-devel is finally able to decode OLE2 (Microsoft Office) files and
decompress VBA streams ! The code is developed by Trog, official ClamAV
developer. Also we're testing new clamd implementation that will solve
several important problems (especially that "Time out" related). Please
help us and test the latest CVS version.


The virus database now contains more than 20.000 signatures ! On January 8,
Denis De Messemacker (who joined our team 3 months ago) added signatures for
about 7700 new viruses. Also special thanks go to Tomasz Papszun for his
hard work on daily submissions and forcing us to keep ClamAV quality on
the highest possible level.


New mirroring mechanisms. Luca Gibelli (ClamAV) and mirror administrators
(22 sites, http://www.clamav.net/mirrors.html, please see clamdoc.pdf for
a complete mirror information) are converting mirrors to new "push mirroring"
method. It uses advanced techniques to ensure all the mirrors are up to date.

0.60
----

Hello again...

This is a new, (very?) stable release of Clam AntiVirus. 0.60 was developed
and stabilized for over seven months and many people had contributed to the
final release. This version introduces many enhancements and a new program:
clamav-milter written by ClamAV developer Nigel Horne. This is a mail scanner
for Sendmail/milter written entirely in C, which uses clamd for virus scanning.
Clamav-milter and clamd duet is a powerful solution for systems where high
performance is required. Please check clamdoc for more detail.


    Many people get confused with ClamAV database status because of
    the OpenAntiVirus update information at:
	    http://openantivirus.org/latest.php
    (last update at 17 October, 2002). The ClamAV virus database contains
    the OAV database (with some signatures fixed or removed) but we
    develop it independently of the OAV project. Our database is updated
    frequently (on average 4-5 times a week). You can help (or join) us -
    will find some basic but useful instructions at
	    http://clamav.elektrapro.com/doc/signatures.pdf


News from ClamAV world:

-) New email address for virus submitting: virus@clamav.elektrapro.com
   You don't need to encrypt a virus sample, but if your system doesn't allow
   you to send infected files just put it into an encrypted zip archive
   (password: virus)

   Special thanks to Nicholas Chua, Diego D'Ambra, Hrvoje Habjanic, Nigel Kukard
   and Chris van Meerendonk for a big number of samples submitted.

-) New mailing list: virusdb@clamav.elektrapro.com
   After each update an email with subject "[clamav-virusdb] Update" and a list
   of viruses added is sent to it. You can set up a procmail rule for freshclam
   to react on such a mails (and update the database just after an update).

-) New official mirrors:
    + clamav.ozforces.com: database mirror updated manually (thanks to
      Andrew <andrew@ozforces.com>)
    + clamav.essentkabel.com: full (automatic) mirror of clamav.elektrapro.com
      (thanks to Chris van Meerendonk <cvm@castel.nl>)
    + clamav.linux-sxs.org: database mirror - rsync from clamav.ozforces.com
      (thanks to Douglas J Hunley <doug@hunley.homeip.net>)

    Freshclam will automatically use them when the main server is not
    accessible.

-) Official port in FreeBSD available ! (maintained by Masahiro Teramoto
   <markun@onohara.to>)

-) Unofficial port for OpenBSD is available at:
	http://www.activeintra.net/openbsd/article.php?id=5
   (maintained by Flinn Mueller <flinn@activeintra.net>)

-) there are many new programs that use ClamAV, eg. mod_clamav (Apache
   virus scanning filter), clamdmail or Sagator. You will find more
   info in clamdoc.

-) libclamav:
    + fixed buffer overflow in unrarlib (patch by Robbert Kouprie
      <robbert@exx.nl>)

    + various mbox code updates (fixed memory leak; added support for decoding
      viruses sent in message bodies, detection of viruses that put their
      payloads after the end of message marker (thanks to Stephen White
      <stephen@earth.li> for the bug report and useful CGI tools); 

    + zziplib updated to 0.10.81 (some problems with older version were reported
      by Martin Schitter)
    + direct scanning of mbox/maildir files (new directive CL_MAIL)
    + file scanner optimization (patch by Hendrik Muhs
      <Hendrik.Muhs@student.uni-magdeburg.de>)
    + bzip2 support
    + faster detection of malformed Zip archives (eg. 'Zip of Death'), they are
      reported as a viruses
    + fixed strcasecmp() compile problem in zziplib on Free/NetBSD and others


-) clamd:
    + fixed descriptor leak in directory scanner - it was causing random
      clamd crashes and locks, especially on highly loaded servers. Reported
      by Kristof Petr <Kristof.P@fce.vutbr.cz>.

    + fixed crash with archive scanning on BSD (increased thread stack size)
      (Nigel Horne)
    + fixed CONTSCAN command (used by clamdscan) - it had archive support
      disabled (hardcoded)
    + fixed SelfCheck option (there was a logic bug, and the option was
      disabled) it now checks a databases time stamps and reloads them
      if needed.
    + fixed possible writing to undefined descriptors (bug found by
      Brian May <bam@debian.org>)
    + new STREAM command (scanning data on socket) and directives:
      StreamSaveToDisk (save stream to disk to allow scanning within archives),
      StreamMaxLength. This option allows scanning data on socket (might be
      sent from another host), currently only clamav-milter uses this.

    + new ScanMail directive for scanning into mbox/Maildir files
    + new directive: ArchiveLimitMemoryUsage (limit memory usage with bzip2)
    + new directive: AllowSupplementaryGroups (feature requested by Exiscan
      users)
    + syslog support (LogSyslog) (patch by Hrvoje Habjanic
      <hrvoje.habjanic@zg.hinet.hr>)
    + fixed parser segfault with extra space between option and argument
      in config file (Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)

      internal unpacker) (patch by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
    + --move option for moving infected files into a specified directory
      (by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
    + --mbox enables a direct support for mbox files
      (ex. clamscan --mbox /var/spool/mail)
    + fixed --log (-l) option
    + fixed -i option (patch by Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)
    + enabled default archive limits (max-files = 500, max-size = 10M,
      max-recursion = 5)
    + use arj instead of non-free unarj (patch by Magnus Ekdahl)
    + use unzoo instead of non-free zoo (patch by Magnus Ekdahl)
    + removed thread support

freshclam:
    + mirror support (implemented by Damien Curtain <damien@pagefault.org>)
    + --proxy-user: proxy authorization support (implemented by Gernot Tenchio
      <g.tenchio@telco-tech.de>)
    + new options --on-error-execute, --on-update-execute
      (ex. freshclam -d -c 6 --on-error-execute "sendsms 23332243 Can't
      update virus database"). Idea by Douglas J Hunley <doug@hunley.homeip.net>

configure:
    + --disable-cr (don't link with C reentrant library (needed on some newer
      versions of OpenBSD))

-) Enhanced AIX (thanks to Mike Loewen <mloewen@sturgeon.cac.psu.edu>) and
   Tru64 support (thanks to Christophe Varoqui <ext.devoteam.varoqui@sncf.fr>)

-) documentation:
    + included how-to in Portugese by Alexandre de Jesus Marcolino
    + clamdoc.pdf and system manual updates

Many thanks to Luca 'NERvOus' Gibelli from ElektraPro for his support,
to Ken McKittrick from USA DataNet for a fully accessible FreeBSD box and

0.54
----
Many major changes this time...

-) libclamav:
    + fixed segfault with some strange zip archives (there is a bug in zziplib,
      libclamav contains a work around for it) (the problem was reported by
      Oliver Paukstadt <pstadt@stud.fh-heilbronn.de>)
    + engine improvements (better support for a detection of new viruses,
      limited memory usage (consumes ~ 5 Mb now))
    + mbox code updated and moved into the library: fixed core dump when an
      embedded message includes a mime header with the line Content-Type:
      without specifying the type of content, fixed (theoretical) memory leak,
      support for multipart/report messages, fixed bug causing some formats to
      fail to scan) (Nigel)
-) clamd:
    + new commands: CONTSCAN (it doesn't stop scanning even when virus is
      found), VERSION
    + disable logging of a unnecessary time stamps with LogTime when
      LogVerbose isn't used (patch by Ed Phillips <ed@UDel.Edu>)
-) freshclam:
    + "Cache-Control: no-cache" enabled by default
    + Cygwin support fix
-) clamdscan:
    + initial version
-) all tools:
    + removed huge printf() in help() (there was a buffer overflow problem with
      --help option under Windows and SCO Unix (reported by Wojciech Noworyta
      <wnow@konarski.edu.pl> and Nigel respectively)
-) configure:
    + allow configuration of the clamav user and group with --with-user and
      --with-group (patch by Patrick Bihan-Faou <patrick@mindstep.com>)
    + --enable-id-check - it uses the check procedure from Jason Englander
      <jason@englanders.cc>, currently it will fail on systems with getent
      which doesn't detect clamav group.
    + do not overwrite the existing config file


There are initial packages for Windows available at:
    http://clamav.elektrapro.com/binary

--tk


0.53
----
This release has removed the limit for a file name length in clamscan. Some
viruses (eg. W32/Yaha.E) are using very long file names, and they were
ignored in mbox mode. Users of AMaViS-ng and other wrappers were not
vulnerable to this problem, because that programs don't use original
attachement file names.

-) clamscan:
    + removed limit for a file name length (thanks to Odhiambo Washington
      <wash@wananchi.com> for the test files and extensive mbox testing)
    + mbox: adapted to the new changes, enabled thread support (Nigel),
	    re-enabled temporary directory removing.

0.52
----

This version contains a portability fixes - it should compile on OpenBSD,
MacOSX and NetBSD (support for them was broken in 0.51). 

-) clamd: various fixes:
	+ drop supplementary groups (suggested by Enrico Scholz
	  <enrico.scholz@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de>) (this has been implemented
	  in freshclam, too)
	+ work-around for the segmentation fault at QUIT under FreeBSD
	+ check timeouts when waiting for threads in RELOAD mode
	+ SelfCheck - internal integrity check (by default every 1 hour)
	+ fixed problem with directory scanning on non typical file systems
	  (bug reported by Jason Englander <jason@englanders.cc>)
	+ clamd is a system command (clamd.1 -> clamd.8, /usr/local/bin ->
	  /usr/local/sbin) (Magnus Ekdahl)
-) clamscan:
	+ mbox code updates (Nigel Horne) - it fixes some problems on *BSD
	  systems (see mailing lists archives for the details)
	+ enable core dumping (Nigel Horne) [ with --enable-debug ]
-) freshclam:
	+ applied http-proxy patch from http://bugs.debian.org/clamav (by
	  Martin Lesser <admin-debian@bettercom.de>)
	+ when configured with --disable-cache, freshclam forces 'no-cache'
	  option in proxy servers (patch by Ant La Porte <ant@dvere.net>)

-) HPUX (10.20/11.0 tested) support (thanks to Joe Oaks <joe.oaks@hp.com>)
-) fixed support for SCO Unix and BeOS (Nigel Horne)
-) support/mboxscan: new version with SpamAssassin support (Nigel Horne)
-) re-included TrashScan 0.08 (by Trashware <trashware@gmx.de>) - the security
   issue has been fixed.
-) included "Installing qmail-scanner, Clam Antivirus and SpamAssassin under
   FreeBSD" how-to by Paul Hoadley and Eric Parsonage


0.51
----

OAV database is up to date ! There was a problem with signature parsing,
because some hex strings were upper case. Anyway, I still recommend you
freshclam for a database updating.

-) support for the genuine OAV database
-) limited memory usage (at the cost of speed, increase CL_MIN_LENGTH in
   libclamav/clamav.h to make it faster, it's safe to set it on 3-4 for
   the OAV database)
-) fixed compile problem on TurboLinux 6.5 (probably others, too), the bug
   was reported by Henk Kuipers <henk@opensourcesolutions.nl>.
-) clamd: fixed THREXIT (thanks to Piotr Gackiewicz <gacek@intertele.pl>)
-) clamd: fixed serious bug with thread argument type
-) clamscan: mbox: don't scan empty attachments (Nigel Horne)
-) configure: --with-db1, --with-db2 (suggested by Magnus Ekdahl)


0.50
----

Here it is...
Clam AntiVirus 0.50 contains an anti-virus library - libclamav, a fully
multi-threaded daemon clamd(1) and a quite long list of changes. The
documentation was rewritten and you _should_ review it. By courtesy of
NERvOus <nervous@nervous.it> and ElektraPro, there are three mailing lists
available - you can subscribe via www at http://clamav.elektrapro.com/ml.
Please check the manual for more information.


New software:

-) libclamav with RAR, Zip and Gzip support built-in. The library is thread
   safe and should be very secure, also. It uses UniquE RAR File
   Library by Christian Scheurer and Johannes Winkelmann (RAR 2.0 support only)
   and zziplib library by Guido Draheim and Tomi Ollila. Both of them are
   included and slightly modified in the clamav sources. You need the zlib
   library for the Zip/Gzip support, though. The API is described with
   examples in the clamdoc.

-) clamd: a modern anti-virus daemon. It uses configuration file clamav.conf
   described in the clamav.conf(5) manual. The program was written with
   security as a goal. 

-) clamuko: on-access scanning under Linux. It utilizes Dazuko kernel module
   (GPL, http://dazuko.org) and is clamd-based.

New features / improvements:

-) enhanced scanner engine (better detection of some complex polymorphic
   viruses)

-) clamscan: Nigel Horne <njh@bandsman.co.uk> has added the ability to scan
   mail attachments in a filter. For example:

   $ clamscan -i --mbox - < /var/spool/mail/john
   /tmp/aa6b9fc06bc477ae/setup.exe: Worm/Klez.H FOUND

   Nigel is the author of the whole mbox code in clamscan. Currently it only
   works in a filter mode, but there are plans to move the code into the
   libclamav and allow clamd using it. Please check support/mboxscan, also.

-) clamscan: support for including and excluding multiple patterns with
   --include and --exclude (patch by Alejandro Dubrovsky
   <s328940@student.uq.edu.au>).
   Example: clamscan --include .exe --include .obj --include .scr /mnt/windows

-) clamscan: don't scan /proc files (Linux, st_dev comparing). No more
   /proc/kcore related mails :))

-) clamscan: use libclamav's archive support by default (it's enabled by default
   and may be disabled with --disable-archive) and switch to the external
   unpackers (if specified) in the case of libclamav archive code error.

-) freshclam: proxy support (via $http_proxy variable and --http-proxy).
   I started implementing proxy support some time ago, but never finished.
   Nigel Horne did the great job and has finished the proxy support !

-) freshclam: --daemon-notify. freshclam will send the RELOAD command to the
   daemon after database update (supports both tcp and local sockets, it reads
   clamav.conf to determine the socket type).

-) freshclam: support for viruses.db2

Bug fixes:

-) freshclam: log 'Database updated' message (thanks to Jeffrey Moskot
    <jef@math.miami.edu> for the bug report). It now prints a number
    of signatures in a database, also.

-) clamscan: fixed compile problem on Solaris 8 and some other systems -
   #include <signal.h> lack in others.c (thanks Mike Loewen
   <mloewen@sturgeon.cac.psu.edu> for the bug report)

Documentation:

-) included Japanese documentation by Masaki Ogawa <proc@mac.com>

-) updated Spanish "Sendmail + Amavis + ClamAv - Como" by Erick I. Lopez
   Carreon <elopezc@technitrade.com>

-) rewritten clamdoc, included clamdoc-html, removed PostScript version (.ps)

-) Clam-Mutant ;) logo update by Michal Hajduczenia <michalis@mat.uni.torun.pl>

-) new man pages: clamd(1), clamav.conf(5); others updated


!!!
    Please don't use the oav-update script with this version. It doesn't
update viruses.db2 and supports OpenAntiVirus.org site only (the last
update of the OAV database was 1 July !). Nicholas Chua <nicholas@ncmbox.net>
has generated over 200 new signatures, ClamAV's database is also frequently
updated (expecially when new wild virus/worm appears, eg. W32/BugBear.A).

    This software is still in developement (new software == new bugs), however
clamscan should be very stable. You shouldn't use clamd/clamuko (well, clamd is
stable, clamuko isn't) on production systems, yet. Please wait for 0.51 at
least ;). ClamAV 0.50 was tested on Linux and Solaris and should work fine.
There is a problem with clamd on FreeBSD (tested on my FreeBSD 5.0-CURRENT) -
the daemon crashes with Zip/Gzip files (disabling ScanArchive should help).

Enjoy !

0.24
----

-) fixed threads deadlock in a critical error situation (bug found by David
   Sanchez <dsanchez@veloxia.com>)
-) fixed sigtool bug (negative seeking)
-) fixed potential clamscan segfault in the case of memory allocation error
-) unpacker execution error is no longer treated as critical - a few programs
   (eg. Qmail-Scanner, TrashScan) have clamscan command hardcoded with all
   archive options turned on. Now, if unpacker can't be executed, raw file is
   scanned and scan process is continued.
-) reverted to pthread.h detection
-) TrashScan 0.07 (Trashware <trashware@gmx.net>)
-) --exclude (regular expressions are not supported !)
   [ex: clamscan --exclude="/proc/kcore" /], but please use it with care.
-) included html documentation

IMPORTANT NOTE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will probably have a problem with a default Qmail-Scanner (1.13 or newer)
installation. You need to increase qmail-smtpd softlimit or disable it. You
can force clamscan to use only half of the memory which it uses by default, too.
Please change the following line in the clamscan/matcher.h file:
    #define MIN_LENGTH 5
to:
    #define MIN_LENGTH 3
and recompile the program. Unhappily, scanning may be a little slower in some
cases, but it shouldn't be significant. Then you can safely set the qmail
softlimit to 8 MB. I want to thank Doug Monroe <doug@planetconnect.com> for
his contribution in the problem analysis.
---

New ClamAV version is in a heavy development. It has currently built-in
support for RAR, Zip, Gzip and tar. The daemon will support only built-in
compression/archive support. Snapshot will be available for a few days.

0.23
----

-) fixed compile problem on FreeBSD (thanks to Wieslaw Glod <wkg@x2.pl> and
   Ken McKittrick <klmac@usadatanet.com>)
-) clamscan reads all .db files from data directory, so you can put your
   own databases there and they won't be overwrited by the updaters. viruses.db
   is still the main database file (if --database isn't used).
-) --deb (debian binary packages scanning) by Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>
-) --remove option, but be careful with it !
-) new clam logo ;) (GPL) by Michal Hajduczenia <michalis@mat.uni.torun.pl>.
-) TrashScan 0.06 (by Trashware <trashware@gmx.net>) - a script for scanning
   mail with procmail. I recommend it. (support/trashscan)
-) documentation updates

0.30 release will contain a daemon and an anti-virus library (with simple API),
so you can use it directly in your projects. I want to build in zip and rar
support, also.

There are binary packages for AIX available. Please check the documentation.

0.22
----

This release fixes bug with scanning archives in unaccessible directories with
*superuser* priviledges (after dropping priviledges scanner wasn't able to
access the archive, although the same archive was accessible), thanks
for Sergei Pronin <sp@finndesign.fi> for the problem description. Now all
archives unaccessible directly by the clamav user are copied (with a respect to
--max-space) to the temporary directory. All old filesystem tricks were removed.

Other fixes / improvements:

-) better error handling, new error codes
-) improved -i (--infected) option
-) removed --strange-unzip option
-) removed eicar test files and logos from the documentation due to the GPL
   (thanks for Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>), ClamAV-Test-Signature is
   used instead
-) removed Qmail-Scanner patch, ClamAV is supported by Q-S 1.13 (thanks guys!)
-) code cleanups


0.21 Release
------------

It fixes following problems:

-) database downloading in freshclam/0.20
-) malformed amavis-perl patch from 0.20
-) clamscan problems with some unzip versions, please try --strange-unzip
   option

ClamAV 0.21 source package contains initial support for NetBSD
(thanks to Marc Baudoin <babafou@babafou.eu.org>, Jean-Edouard BABIN
<Jeb@jeb.com.fr>), better support for Mac OS X (Masaki Ogawa <proc@mac.com>),
and clamdoc documentation corrected by Dennis Leeuw <dleeuw@made-it.com>.


0.20 Release
------------

The most important change in this release is a new, linear pattern matching
algorithm. You will find more informations about it in clamscan/matcher.c -
in the sources and in clamdoc. Summary (since 0.15):

New features:

-) fast pattern matching algorithm
-) sigtool utility, check `man sigtool` and clamdoc
-) Linux: threads autodetection on various architectures
          (Magnus Ekdahl <magnus@debian.org>)
-) -i, --infected: clamscan prints only infected files
-) 'Data scanned' in summary, size in megabytes with 16 Kb precision
-) configure: --with-dbdir sets the database location
-) support/sigmake shell script by Dennis Leeuw <leeuw@stone-it.com>
-) Spanish "Sendmail+Amavis+ClamAv installation how-to" by
   Erick I. Lopez Carreon <elopezc@technitrade.com>

Updates:

-) "Debian GNU/Linux Mail Server v. 0.2.0" by Dennis Leeuw <leeuw@stone-it.com>
-) qmail-scanner patch from Kazuhiko <kazuhiko@fdiary.net>
-) general documentation cleanups / updates
-) freshclam / Internet database location

Fixes:

-) threads autodetection on not-x86 Linux systems
-) gcc 3.x support (David Ford <david+cert@blue-labs.org>)
-) data type fix on Mac OS X (Peter N Lewis <peter@stairways.com.au>)
-) removed -w, --whole-file, now clamscan scans whole files by default
   -w is still supported by internal getopt(), because it is used in
   various patches
-) removed --one-virus, still supported by getopt(); removed 'Found viruses'
   from summary, clamscan stops file scanning after first virus
-) fixed old problem with scanning stdin
-) removed amavisd-patch - strange problems have been reported

OpenAntiVirus Update is a great tool written by Matthew A. Grant
<grantma@anathoth.gen.nz> and it will be the primary updater for ClamAV
in the near future. In contrast to freshclam it has proxy support and many
specific features. Please check clamdoc for more informations and how to
obtain it.


0.15 Notes
----------

This version contains minor bugfixes only, such as:
    -) multiple fixes in freshclam (it has problems, when one of the
       hosts wasn't accessible), there were logic flaws in the code
    -) fixed problem with password protected archives (unpackers were waiting
       for password)

New features:
    -) OpenBSD support (thanks to Kamil Andrusz <wizz@mniam.net>)
    -) added support for amavisd, qmail-scanner (see ./support)

There were no major bugs and I was very busy, that's why new version is
released just today. In the next 2 months, clamav development will be much
faster. Here are some of my plans:

    ~ 0.20 : New pattern-matching algorithm
    ~ 0.30 : clamlib; clamscan and the daemon based on it

There is a new homepage:

		http://clamav.elektrapro.com

Thanks to ElektraPro.com for sponsoring this site (it's very fast).
Thanks to NERvOus <nervous@nervous.it>.

If you are interested in current development versions, please check
snapshots link.

Resource usage limits in 0.14
-----------------------------

Two new features: --max-files, --max-space have been implemented. If you have
enabled one of this options, clamscan monitors resource usage (number of
created files and used space) and stops extractor when it has exceeded
the limit. You should use these options to protect your machine against
Denial of Service attacks. In the near future --max-levels (limit for
recursive archives extracting) and --max-time (spent on checking/extracting
files) will be implemented.


FreeBSD: AMaViS compile problems
--------------------------------

Please check FAQ.

!!! Strange signatures in VirusSignatures-2002.04.15.10.51.zip !!!
------------------------------------------------------------------

Last version of signatures was ~90 kb, this version is ~474 kb.
But I don't understand, why some signatures are mega-huge. When I decoded
them, they looked like regular files. In CA they were removed from the
database and I probably add them later, in normal sizes.

Installation :
--------------

Please view documentation in ./docs. There are several formats - pdf, ps
and plain latex, if you want to compile it yourself.

You need GNU make (on Solaris you should have gmake).
It was tested only with gcc 2.9x compilers.
