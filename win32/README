ClamAV for Win32
----------------

--- News ---

In order to support more advanced features planned in future releases, 
ClamAV has switched to using OpenSSL for hashing. The ClamAV Visual Studio 
project included with ClamAV's source code requires the OpenSSL 
distributables to be placed in a specific directory. This article will 
teach you how to compile OpenSSL on a Microsoft Windows system and how 
to link ClamAV against OpenSSL.

Starting from version 0.98 the windows version of ClamAV requires all the
input to be UTF-8 encoded.
This affects:
- the API, notably the cl_scanfile() function
- clamd socket input, e.g. the commands SCAN, CONTSCAN, MUTLISCAN, etc.
- clamd socket output, i.e replies to the above queries

For legacy reasons ANSI (i.e. CP_ACP) input will still be accepted and
processed as before, but with two important remarks:
First, socket replies to ANSI queries will still be UTF-8 encoded.
Second, ANSI sequences which are also valid UTF-8 sequences will be handled
as UTF-8.

As a side note, console output (stdin and stderr) will always be OEM encoded,
even when redirected to a file.


--- Requirements ---

To build the source code you will need:
- Git for windows with a git "shell"
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 SP1: the express version builds the 32bit
target just fine but it requires a decent amount of fiddling in order to
compile the 64bit target; this configuration is therefore not supported.

To run the binaries at least Windows XP is required.


--- Getting the code ---

The win32 source code is merged in the ClamAV repository and is available
via git.
Clone the repository with: git clone git://git.clamav.net/git/clamav-devel
See http://www.clamav.net/download/sources for more info.


--- Code configuration ---

After downloading the source code, minimal configuration is required:
just run the win32/configure.bat script *from within the git shell*.
Skip this step if you are building from an official release tarball.


--- Compilation ---

Open win32/ClamAV.sln in Visual Studio and build all.
The output directory for the binaries is either /win32/(Win32|x64)/Debug or
/win32/(Win32|x64)/Release depending on the configuration you pick.

Note: at the time of writing Batch Build is broken in VS10:

Use MSBuild instead.


--- Special notes ---

The ClamAV tools in win32 are the same as in unix, so refer to their respective
manpage for general usage.
The major differences are listed below:
- Config files path search order:
  1- The content of the registry key
     "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ClamAV/ConfDir"
  2- The directory where libclamav.dll is located
  3- "C:\ClamAV"

- Database files path search order:
  1- The content of the registry key
     "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ClamAV/DataDir"
  2- The directory "database" inside the directory where libclamav.dll is
     located
  3- "C:\ClamAV\db"

- Globbing
Since the windows command prompt doesn't take care of wildcard expansion,
minimal emulation of unix glob() is performed internally.
It supports "*" and "?" only.

- File paths
Please always use the backslash as the path separator.
SMB Network shares and UNC paths are supported.

- Debug builds
Malloc in debug (as opposed to release) mode fails after allocating some 90k
chunks; such builds won't be able to handle large databases.
Just do yourself a favour and always build in release mode.
