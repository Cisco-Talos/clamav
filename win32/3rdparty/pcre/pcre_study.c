/* This function scans a compiled unanchored expression recursively and
attempts to build a bitmap of the set of possible starting bytes. As time goes
by, we may be able to get more clever at doing this. The SSB_CONTINUE return is
useful for parenthesized groups in patterns such as (a*)b where the group
provides some optional starting bytes but scanning must continue at the outer
level to find at least one mandatory byte. At the outermost level, this
function fails unless the result is SSB_DONE.
