/* This module contains global variables that are exported by the PCRE library.
PCRE is thread-clean and doesn't use any global variables in the normal sense.
However, it calls memory allocation and freeing functions via the four
indirections below, and it can optionally do callouts, using the fifth
indirection. These values can be changed by the caller, but are shared between
all threads. However, when compiling for Virtual Pascal, things are done
differently, and global variables are not used (see pcre.in). */

/**************************************************************************
This code used to be here for use when compiling as a C++ library. However,
according to Dair Grant it is not needed: "

 Including 'extern "C"' in the declaration generates an "initialized and
 declared `extern'" warning from gcc 4.0.1. Since we include pcre_internal.h,
 which includes pcre.h, which declares these prototypes within an extern "C" {}
 block, we shouldn't need the prefix here.

So, from Release 7.0 I have cut this out.

extern "C" int   (*pcre_callout)(pcre_callout_block *) = NULL;
