/* This is a newer "info" function which has an extensible interface so
that additional items can be added compatibly.

Arguments:
  argument_re      points to compiled code
  extra_data       points extra data, or NULL
  what             what information is required
  where            where to put the information

Returns:           0 if data returned, negative on error
