/* PCRE keeps offsets in its compiled code as 2-byte quantities (always stored
in big-endian order) by default. These are used, for example, to link from the
start of a subpattern to its alternatives and its end. The use of 2 bytes per
offset limits the size of the compiled regex to around 64K, which is big enough
for almost everybody. However, I received a request for an even bigger limit.
For this reason, and also to make the code easier to maintain, the storing and
loading of offsets from the byte string is now handled by the macros that are
defined here.

The macros are controlled by the value of LINK_SIZE. This defaults to 2 in
the config.h file, but can be overridden by using -D on the command line. This
is automated on Unix systems via the "configure" command. */
