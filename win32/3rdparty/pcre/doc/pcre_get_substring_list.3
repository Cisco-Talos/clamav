.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.rs
.sp
This is a convenience function for extracting a list of all the captured
substrings. The arguments are:
.sp
  \fIsubject\fP       Subject that has been successfully matched
  \fIovector\fP       Offset vector that \fBpcre_exec\fP used
  \fIstringcount\fP   Value returned by \fBpcre_exec\fP
  \fIlistptr\fP       Where to put a pointer to the list
.sp
The memory in which the substrings and the list are placed is obtained by
calling \fBpcre_malloc()\fP. The convenience function
\fBpcre_free_substring_list()\fP can be used to free it when it is no longer
needed. A pointer to a list of pointers is put in the variable whose address is
in \fIlistptr\fP. The list is terminated by a NULL pointer. The yield of the
function is zero on success or PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if sufficient memory could
not be obtained.
